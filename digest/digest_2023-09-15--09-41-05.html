                Authors: Chenhan Xiao, Yizheng Liao, Yang Weng <br>
                Abstract: Line outage identification in distribution grids is essential for sustainable grid operation. In this work, we propose a practical yet robust detection approach that utilizes only readily available voltage magnitudes, eliminating the need for costly phase angles or power flow data. Given the sensor data, many existing detection methods based on change-point detection require prior knowledge of outage patterns, which are unknown for real-world outage scenarios. To remove this impractical requirement, we propose a data-driven method to learn the parameters of the post-outage distribution through gradient descent. However, directly using gradient descent presents feasibility issues. To address this, we modify our approach by adding a Bregman divergence constraint to control the trajectory of the parameter updates, which eliminates the feasibility problems. As timely operation is the key nowadays, we prove that the optimal parameters can be learned with convergence guarantees via leveraging the statistical and physical properties of voltage data. We evaluate our approach using many representative distribution grids and real load profiles with 17 outage configurations. The results show that we can detect and localize the outage in a timely manner with only voltage magnitudes and without assuming a prior knowledge of outage patterns.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07158">Compressed Real Numbers for AI: a case-study using a RISC-V CPU</a><br>

                Abstract: As recently demonstrated, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), usually trained using single precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers (binary32), can also work using lower precision. Therefore, 16-bit and 8-bit compressed format have attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focused on two families of formats that have already achieved interesting results in compressing binary32 numbers in machine learning applications, without sensible degradation of the accuracy: bfloat and posit. Even if 16-bit and 8-bit bfloat/posit are routinely used for reducing the storage of the weights/biases of trained DNNs, the inference still often happens on the 32-bit FPU of the CPU (especially if GPUs are not available). In this paper we propose a way to decompress a tensor of bfloat/posits just before computations, i.e., after the compressed operands have been loaded within the vector registers of a vector capable CPU, in order to save bandwidth usage and increase cache efficiency. Finally, we show the architectural parameters and considerations under which this solution is advantageous with respect to the uncompressed one.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07168">Goal Space Abstraction in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via  Reachability Analysis</a><br>
                Authors: Mehdi Zadem (LIX, U2IS), Sergio Mover (LIX), Sao Mai Nguyen (U2IS, Flowers, IMT Atlantique - INFO, Lab-STICC_RAMBO) <br>
                Abstract: Open-ended learning benefits immensely from the use of symbolic methods for goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical information, such as the environment dynamics. In this work, we propose a developmental mechanism for subgoal discovery via an emergent representation that abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar roles in the task. We create a HRL algorithm that gradually learns this representation along with the policies and evaluate it on navigation tasks to show the learned representation is interpretable and results in data efficiency.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07172">Exploring Large Language Models for Ontology Alignment</a><br>
                Authors: Yuan He, Jiaoyan Chen, Hang Dong, Ian Horrocks <br>
                Abstract: This work investigates the applicability of recent generative Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT series and Flan-T5, to ontology alignment for identifying concept equivalence mappings across ontologies. To test the zero-shot performance of Flan-T5-XXL and GPT-3.5-turbo, we leverage challenging subsets from two equivalence matching datasets of the OAEI Bio-ML track, taking into account concept labels and structural contexts. Preliminary findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to outperform existing ontology alignment systems like BERTMap, given careful framework and prompt design.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07173">Using Unsupervised and Supervised Learning and Digital Twin for Deep  Convective Ice Storm Classification</a><br>
                Authors: Jason Swope, Steve Chien, Emily Dunkel, Xavier Bosch-Lluis, Qing Yue, William Deal <br>
                Abstract: Smart Ice Cloud Sensing (SMICES) is a small-sat concept in which a primary radar intelligently targets ice storms based on information collected by a lookahead radiometer. Critical to the intelligent targeting is accurate identification of storm/cloud types from eight bands of radiance collected by the radiometer. The cloud types of interest are: clear sky, thin cirrus, cirrus, rainy anvil, and convection core. We describe multi-step use of Machine Learning and Digital Twin of the Earth's atmosphere to derive such a classifier. First, a digital twin of Earth's atmosphere called a Weather Research Forecast (WRF) is used generate simulated lookahead radiometer data as well as deeper "science" hidden variables. The datasets simulate a tropical region over the Caribbean and a non-tropical region over the Atlantic coast of the United States. A K-means clustering over the scientific hidden variables was utilized by human experts to generate an automatic labelling of the data - mapping each physical data point to cloud types by scientists informed by mean/centroids of hidden variables of the clusters. Next, classifiers were trained with the inputs of the simulated radiometer data and its corresponding label. The classifiers of a random decision forest (RDF), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian na\"ive bayes, feed forward artificial neural network (ANN), and a convolutional neural network (CNN) were trained. Over the tropical dataset, the best performing classifier was able to identify non-storm and storm clouds with over 80% accuracy in each class for a held-out test set. Over the non-tropical dataset, the best performing classifier was able to classify non-storm clouds with over 90% accuracy and storm clouds with over 40% accuracy. Additionally both sets of classifiers were shown to be resilient to instrument noise.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07174">HurriCast: An Automatic Framework Using Machine Learning and Statistical  Modeling for Hurricane Forecasting</a><br>
                Authors: Shouwei Gao, Meiyan Gao, Yuepeng Li, Wenqian Dong <br>
                Abstract: Hurricanes present major challenges in the U.S. due to their devastating impacts. Mitigating these risks is important, and the insurance industry is central in this effort, using intricate statistical models for risk assessment. However, these models often neglect key temporal and spatial hurricane patterns and are limited by data scarcity. This study introduces a refined approach combining the ARIMA model and K-MEANS to better capture hurricane trends, and an Autoencoder for enhanced hurricane simulations. Our experiments show that this hybrid methodology effectively simulate historical hurricane behaviors while providing detailed projections of potential future trajectories and intensities. Moreover, by leveraging a comprehensive yet selective dataset, our simulations enrich the current understanding of hurricane patterns and offer actionable insights for risk management strategies.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07176">Optimal and Fair Encouragement Policy Evaluation and Learning</a><br>
                Authors: Angela Zhou <br>
                Abstract: In consequential domains, it is often impossible to compel individuals to take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to enroll in insurance and from pretrial supervised release with electronic monitoring.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07186">LCReg: Long-Tailed Image Classification with Latent Categories based  Recognition</a><br>
                Authors: Weide Liu, Zhonghua Wu, Yiming Wang, Henghui Ding, Fayao Liu, Jie Lin, Guosheng Lin <br>
                Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of long-tailed image recognition. Previous long-tailed recognition approaches mainly focus on data augmentation or re-balancing strategies for the tail classes to give them more attention during model training. However, these methods are limited by the small number of training images for the tail classes, which results in poor feature representations. To address this issue, we propose the Latent Categories based long-tail Recognition (LCReg) method. Our hypothesis is that common latent features shared by head and tail classes can be used to improve feature representation. Specifically, we learn a set of class-agnostic latent features shared by both head and tail classes, and then use semantic data augmentation on the latent features to implicitly increase the diversity of the training sample. We conduct extensive experiments on five long-tailed image recognition datasets, and the results show that our proposed method significantly improves the baselines.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07187">Multi-step prediction of chlorophyll concentration based on Adaptive  Graph-Temporal Convolutional Network with Series Decomposition</a><br>
                Authors: Ying Chen, Xiao Li, Hongbo Zhang, Wenyang Song, Chongxuan Xv <br>
                Abstract: Chlorophyll concentration can well reflect the nutritional status and algal blooms of water bodies, and is an important indicator for evaluating water quality. The prediction of chlorophyll concentration change trend is of great significance to environmental protection and aquaculture. However, there is a complex and indistinguishable nonlinear relationship between many factors affecting chlorophyll concentration. In order to effectively mine the nonlinear features contained in the data. This paper proposes a time-series decomposition adaptive graph-time convolutional network ( AGTCNSD ) prediction model. Firstly, the original sequence is decomposed into trend component and periodic component by moving average method. Secondly, based on the graph convolutional neural network, the water quality parameter data is modeled, and a parameter embedding matrix is defined. The idea of matrix decomposition is used to assign weight parameters to each node. The adaptive graph convolution learns the relationship between different water quality parameters, updates the state information of each parameter, and improves the learning ability of the update relationship between nodes. Finally, time dependence is captured by time convolution to achieve multi-step prediction of chlorophyll concentration. The validity of the model is verified by the water quality data of the coastal city Beihai. The results show that the prediction effect of this method is better than other methods. It can be used as a scientific resource for environmental management decision-making.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07189">Learning From Drift: Federated Learning on Non-IID Data via Drift  Regularization</a><br>
                Authors: Yeachan Kim, Bonggun Shin <br>
                Abstract: Federated learning algorithms perform reasonably well on independent and identically distributed (IID) data. They, on the other hand, suffer greatly from heterogeneous environments, i.e., Non-IID data. Despite the fact that many research projects have been done to address this issue, recent findings indicate that they are still sub-optimal when compared to training on IID data. In this work, we carefully analyze the existing methods in heterogeneous environments. Interestingly, we find that regularizing the classifier's outputs is quite effective in preventing performance degradation on Non-IID data. Motivated by this, we propose Learning from Drift (LfD), a novel method for effectively training the model in heterogeneous settings. Our scheme encapsulates two key components: drift estimation and drift regularization. Specifically, LfD first estimates how different the local model is from the global model (i.e., drift). The local model is then regularized such that it does not fall in the direction of the estimated drift. In the experiment, we evaluate each method through the lens of the five aspects of federated learning, i.e., Generalization, Heterogeneity, Scalability, Forgetting, and Efficiency. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of LfD in federated learning with Non-IID data.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07196">Attention-based Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network for  Traffic Flow Prediction in Highway Transportation</a><br>
                Authors: Tianpu Zhang, Weilong Ding, Mengda Xing <br>
                Abstract: As one of the important tools for spatial feature extraction, graph convolution has been applied in a wide range of fields such as traffic flow prediction. However, current popular works of graph convolution cannot guarantee spatio-temporal consistency in a long period. The ignorance of correlational dynamics, convolutional locality and temporal comprehensiveness would limit predictive accuracy. In this paper, a novel Attention-based Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (ADGCRNN) is proposed to improve traffic flow prediction in highway transportation. Three temporal resolutions of data sequence are effectively integrated by self-attention to extract characteristics; multi-dynamic graphs and their weights are dynamically created to compliantly combine the varying characteristics; a dedicated gated kernel emphasizing highly relative nodes is introduced on these complete graphs to reduce overfitting for graph convolution operations. Experiments on two public datasets show our work better than state-of-the-art baselines, and case studies of a real Web system prove practical benefit in highway transportation.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07197">Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in Federated Learning with Trusted  Execution Environments</a><br>
                Authors: Simon Queyrut, Valerio Schiavoni, Pascal Felber <br>
                Abstract: The main premise of federated learning (FL) is that machine learning model updates are computed locally to preserve user data privacy. This approach avoids by design user data to ever leave the perimeter of their device. Once the updates aggregated, the model is broadcast to all nodes in the federation. However, without proper defenses, compromised nodes can probe the model inside their local memory in search for adversarial examples, which can lead to dangerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in image-based applications, adversarial examples consist of images slightly perturbed to the human eye getting misclassified by the local model. These adversarial images are then later presented to a victim node's counterpart model to replay the attack. Typical examples harness dissemination strategies such as altered traffic signs (patch attacks) no longer recognized by autonomous vehicles or seemingly unaltered samples that poison the local dataset of the FL scheme to undermine its robustness. Pelta is a novel shielding mechanism leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that reduce the ability of attackers to craft adversarial samples. Pelta masks inside the TEE the first part of the back-propagation chain rule, typically exploited by attackers to craft the malicious samples. We evaluate Pelta on state-of-the-art accurate models using three well-established datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. We show the effectiveness of Pelta in mitigating six white-box state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, such as Projected Gradient Descent, Momentum Iterative Method, Auto Projected Gradient Descent, the Carlini & Wagner attack. In particular, Pelta constitutes the first attempt at defending an ensemble model against the Self-Attention Gradient attack to the best of our knowledge.

                Authors: Marco Federici, Patrick Forré, Ryota Tomioka, Bastiaan S. Veeling <br>
                Abstract: Markov processes are widely used mathematical models for describing dynamic systems in various fields. However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error. Our experiments demonstrate that T-IB learns information-optimal representations for accurately modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag, outperforming existing time-lagged dimensionality reduction methods.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07207">EarthPT: a foundation model for Earth Observation</a><br>
                Authors: Michael J. Smith, Luke Fleming, James E. Geach <br>
                Abstract: We introduce EarthPT -- an Earth Observation (EO) pretrained transformer. EarthPT is a 700 million parameter decoding transformer foundation model trained in an autoregressive self-supervised manner and developed specifically with EO use-cases in mind. We demonstrate that EarthPT is an effective forecaster that can accurately predict future pixel-level surface reflectances across the 400-2300 nm range well into the future. For example, forecasts of the evolution of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have a typical error of approximately 0.05 (over a natural range of -1 -> 1) at the pixel level over a five month test set horizon, out-performing simple phase-folded models based on historical averaging. We also demonstrate that embeddings learnt by EarthPT hold semantically meaningful information and could be exploited for downstream tasks such as highly granular, dynamic land use classification. Excitingly, we note that the abundance of EO data provides us with -- in theory -- quadrillions of training tokens. Therefore, if we assume that EarthPT follows neural scaling laws akin to those derived for Large Language Models (LLMs), there is currently no data-imposed limit to scaling EarthPT and other similar `Large Observation Models.'<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07235">Autotuning Apache TVM-based Scientific Applications Using Bayesian  Optimization</a><br>
                Authors: Xingfu Wu, Praveen Paramasivam, Valerie Taylor <br>
                Abstract: Apache TVM (Tensor Virtual Machine), an open source machine learning compiler framework designed to optimize computations across various hardware platforms, provides an opportunity to improve the performance of dense matrix factorizations such as LU (Lower Upper) decomposition and Cholesky decomposition on GPUs and AI (Artificial Intelligence) accelerators. In this paper, we propose a new TVM autotuning framework using Bayesian Optimization and use the TVM tensor expression language to implement linear algebra kernels such as LU, Cholesky, and 3mm. We use these scientific computation kernels to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on a GPU cluster, called Swing, at Argonne National Laboratory. We compare the proposed autotuning framework with the TVM autotuning framework AutoTVM with four tuners and find that our framework outperforms AutoTVM in most cases.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07243">LInKs "Lifting Independent Keypoints" -- Partial Pose Lifting for  Occlusion Handling with Improved Accuracy in 2D-3D Human Pose Estimation</a><br>
                Authors: Peter Hardy, Hansung Kim <br>
                Abstract: We present LInKs, a novel unsupervised learning method to recover 3D human poses from 2D kinematic skeletons obtained from a single image, even when occlusions are present. Our approach follows a unique two-step process, which involves first lifting the occluded 2D pose to the 3D domain, followed by filling in the occluded parts using the partially reconstructed 3D coordinates. This lift-then-fill approach leads to significantly more accurate results compared to models that complete the pose in 2D space alone. Additionally, we improve the stability and likelihood estimation of normalising flows through a custom sampling function replacing PCA dimensionality reduction previously used in prior work. Furthermore, we are the first to investigate if different parts of the 2D kinematic skeleton can be lifted independently which we find by itself reduces the error of current lifting approaches. We attribute this to the reduction of long-range keypoint correlations. In our detailed evaluation, we quantify the error under various realistic occlusion scenarios, showcasing the versatility and applicability of our model. Our results consistently demonstrate the superiority of handling all types of occlusions in 3D space when compared to others that complete the pose in 2D space. Our approach also exhibits consistent accuracy in scenarios without occlusion, as evidenced by a 7.9% reduction in reconstruction error compared to prior works on the Human3.6M dataset. Furthermore, our method excels in accurately retrieving complete 3D poses even in the presence of occlusions, making it highly applicable in situations where complete 2D pose information is unavailable.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07251">In-Contextual Bias Suppression for Large Language Models</a><br>
                Authors: Daisuke Oba, Masahiro Kaneko, Danushka Bollegala <br>
                Abstract: Despite their impressive performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to encode worrying-levels of gender bias. Prior work has proposed debiasing methods that require human labelled examples, data augmentation and fine-tuning of the LLMs, which are computationally costly. Moreover, one might not even have access to the internal parameters for performing debiasing such as in the case of commercially available LLMs such as GPT-4. To address this challenge we propose bias suppression, a novel alternative to debiasing that does not require access to model parameters. We show that text-based preambles, generated from manually designed templates covering counterfactual statements, can accurately suppress gender biases in LLMs. Moreover, we find that descriptive sentences for occupations can further suppress gender biases. Interestingly, we find that bias suppression has a minimal adverse effect on downstream task performance, while effectively mitigating the gender biases.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07254">Mitigate Replication and Copying in Diffusion Models with Generalized  Caption and Dual Fusion Enhancement</a><br>
                Authors: Chenghao Li, Dake Chen, Yuke Zhang, Peter A. Beerel <br>
                Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate a remarkable capability for generating high-quality images, their tendency to `replicate' training data raises privacy concerns. Although recent research suggests that this replication may stem from the insufficient generalization of training data captions and duplication of training images, effective mitigation strategies remain elusive. To address this gap, our paper first introduces a generality score that measures the caption generality and employ large language model (LLM) to generalize training captions. Subsequently, we leverage generalized captions and propose a novel dual fusion enhancement approach to mitigate the replication of diffusion models. Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed methods can significantly reduce replication by 43.5% compared to the original diffusion model while maintaining the diversity and quality of generations.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07268">So you think you can track?</a><br>

                Abstract: This work introduces a multi-camera tracking dataset consisting of 234 hours of video data recorded concurrently from 234 overlapping HD cameras covering a 4.2 mile stretch of 8-10 lane interstate highway near Nashville, TN. The video is recorded during a period of high traffic density with 500+ objects typically visible within the scene and typical object longevities of 3-15 minutes. GPS trajectories from 270 vehicle passes through the scene are manually corrected in the video data to provide a set of ground-truth trajectories for recall-oriented tracking metrics, and object detections are provided for each camera in the scene (159 million total before cross-camera fusion). Initial benchmarking of tracking-by-detection algorithms is performed against the GPS trajectories, and a best HOTA of only 9.5% is obtained (best recall 75.9% at IOU 0.1, 47.9 average IDs per ground truth object), indicating the benchmarked trackers do not perform sufficiently well at the long temporal and spatial durations required for traffic scene understanding.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07277">Unbiased Face Synthesis With Diffusion Models: Are We There Yet?</a><br>

                Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved widespread popularity due to their unprecedented image generation capability. In particular, their ability to synthesize and modify human faces has spurred research into using generated face images in both training data augmentation and model performance assessments. In this paper, we study the efficacy and shortcomings of generative models in the context of face generation. Utilizing a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures, including embedding-based metrics and user studies, we present a framework to audit the characteristics of generated faces conditioned on a set of social attributes. We applied our framework on faces generated through state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. We identify several limitations of face image generation that include faithfulness to the text prompt, demographic disparities, and distributional shifts. Furthermore, we present an analytical model that provides insights into how training data selection contributes to the performance of generative models.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07293">GAN-based Algorithm for Efficient Image Inpainting</a><br>

Under such condition, the authors consider utilizing machine learning in image inpainting to tackle the problem, by complete the possible face that is originally covered in mask. In particular, autoencoder has great potential on retaining important, general features of the image as well as the generative power of the generative adversarial network (GAN). The authors implement a combination of the two models, context encoders and explain how it combines the power of the two models and train the model with 50,000 images of influencers faces and yields a solid result that still contains space for improvements. Furthermore, the authors discuss some shortcomings with the model, their possible improvements, as well as some area of study for future investigation for applicative perspective, as well as directions to further enhance and refine the model.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07297">Multi-Modal Hybrid Learning and Sequential Training for RGB-T Saliency  Detection</a><br>
                Authors: Guangyu Ren, Jitesh Joshi, Youngjun Cho <br>
                Abstract: RGB-T saliency detection has emerged as an important computer vision task, identifying conspicuous objects in challenging scenes such as dark environments. However, existing methods neglect the characteristics of cross-modal features and rely solely on network structures to fuse RGB and thermal features. To address this, we first propose a Multi-Modal Hybrid loss (MMHL) that comprises supervised and self-supervised loss functions. The supervised loss component of MMHL distinctly utilizes semantic features from different modalities, while the self-supervised loss component reduces the distance between RGB and thermal features. We further consider both spatial and channel information during feature fusion and propose the Hybrid Fusion Module to effectively fuse RGB and thermal features. Lastly, instead of jointly training the network with cross-modal features, we implement a sequential training strategy which performs training only on RGB images in the first stage and then learns cross-modal features in the second stage. This training strategy improves saliency detection performance without computational overhead. Results from performance evaluation and ablation studies demonstrate the superior performance achieved by the proposed method compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07311">Sudden Drops in the Loss: Syntax Acquisition, Phase Transitions, and  Simplicity Bias in MLMs</a><br>
                Authors: Angelica Chen, Ravid Schwartz-Ziv, Kyunghyun Cho, Matthew L. Leavitt, Naomi Saphra <br>
                Abstract: Most interpretability research in NLP focuses on understanding the behavior and features of a fully trained model. However, certain insights into model behavior may only be accessible by observing the trajectory of the training process. In this paper, we present a case study of syntax acquisition in masked language models (MLMs). Our findings demonstrate how analyzing the evolution of interpretable artifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of emergent behavior. In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS), a naturally emerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend to focus on specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in training when models abruptly acquire SAS and find that this window is concurrent with a steep drop in loss. Moreover, SAS precipitates the subsequent acquisition of linguistic capabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS by introducing a regularizer to manipulate SAS during training, and demonstrate that SAS is necessary for the development of grammatical capabilities. We further find that SAS competes with other beneficial traits and capabilities during training, and that briefly suppressing SAS can improve model quality. These findings reveal a real-world example of the relationship between disadvantageous simplicity bias and interpretable breakthrough training dynamics.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07315">Traveling Words: A Geometric Interpretation of Transformers</a><br>
                Authors: Raul Molina <br>
                Abstract: Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07322">$\texttt{NePhi}$: Neural Deformation Fields for Approximately  Diffeomorphic Medical Image Registration</a><br>

                Abstract: This work proposes $\texttt{NePhi}$, a neural deformation model which results in approximately diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast to the predominant voxel-based approaches, $\texttt{NePhi}$ represents deformations functionally which allows for memory-efficient training and inference. This is of particular importance for large volumetric registrations. Further, while medical image registration approaches representing transformation maps via multi-layer perceptrons have been proposed, $\texttt{NePhi}$ facilitates both pairwise optimization-based registration $\textit{as well as}$ learning-based registration via predicted or optimized global and local latent codes. Lastly, as deformation regularity is a highly desirable property for most medical image registration tasks, $\texttt{NePhi}$ makes use of gradient inverse consistency regularization which empirically results in approximately diffeomorphic transformations. We show the performance of $\texttt{NePhi}$ on two 2D synthetic datasets as well as on real 3D lung registration. Our results show that $\texttt{NePhi}$ can achieve similar accuracies as voxel-based representations in a single-resolution registration setting while using less memory and allowing for faster instance-optimization.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07330">Automated Assessment of Critical View of Safety in Laparoscopic  Cholecystectomy</a><br>
                Authors: Yunfan Li, Himanshu Gupta, Haibin Ling, IV Ramakrishnan, Prateek Prasanna, Georgios Georgakis, Aaron Sasson <br>
                Abstract: Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) is one of the most common procedures in the US, with more than 1.2M procedures annually. Compared with classical open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is associated with significantly shorter recovery period, and hence is the preferred method. However, LC is also associated with an increase in bile duct injuries (BDIs), resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The primary cause of BDIs from LCs is misidentification of the cystic duct with the bile duct. Critical view of safety (CVS) is the most effective of safety protocols, which is said to be achieved during the surgery if certain criteria are met. However, due to suboptimal understanding and implementation of CVS, the BDI rates have remained stable over the last three decades. In this paper, we develop deep-learning techniques to automate the assessment of CVS in LCs. An innovative aspect of our research is on developing specialized learning techniques by incorporating domain knowledge to compensate for the limited training data available in practice. In particular, our CVS assessment process involves a fusion of two segmentation maps followed by an estimation of a certain region of interest based on anatomical structures close to the gallbladder, and then finally determination of each of the three CVS criteria via rule-based assessment of structural information. We achieved a gain of over 11.8% in mIoU on relevant classes with our two-stream semantic segmentation approach when compared to a single-model baseline, and 1.84% in mIoU with our proposed Sobel loss function when compared to a Transformer-based baseline model. For CVS criteria, we achieved up to 16% improvement and, for the overall CVS assessment, we achieved 5% improvement in balanced accuracy compared to DeepCVS under the same experiment settings.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07332">Reliability-based cleaning of noisy training labels with inductive  conformal prediction in multi-modal biomedical data mining</a><br>
                Authors: Xianghao Zhan, Qinmei Xu, Yuanning Zheng, Guangming Lu, Olivier Gevaert <br>
                Abstract: Accurately labeling biomedical data presents a challenge. Traditional semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data. To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation. Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating an excessive volume of meticulously curated training data.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07334">Learning from Auxiliary Sources in Argumentative Revision Classification</a><br>
                Authors: Tazin Afrin, Diane Litman <br>
                Abstract: We develop models to classify desirable reasoning revisions in argumentative writing. We explore two approaches -- multi-task learning and transfer learning -- to take advantage of auxiliary sources of revision data for similar tasks. Results of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations show that both approaches can indeed improve classifier performance over baselines. While multi-task learning shows that training on different sources of data at the same time may improve performance, transfer-learning better represents the relationship between the data.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07344">Efficient Learning of PDEs via Taylor Expansion and Sparse Decomposition  into Value and Fourier Domains</a><br>
                Authors: Md Nasim, Yexiang Xue <br>
                Abstract: Accelerating the learning of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) from experimental data will speed up the pace of scientific discovery. Previous randomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However such methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have sparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the learning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel exploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the value and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when the source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large areas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates concentrated in a small set of "interfacial" regions (sparse in the value domain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for learning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in Reel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the decomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation between the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic number of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence that our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98% reduction in training time when the data is compressed to 1% of its original size) with comparable quality as the non-compressed models.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07361">Judging a video by its bitstream cover</a><br>
                Authors: Yuxing Han, Yunan Ding, Jiangtao Wen, Chen Ye Gan <br>
                Abstract: Classifying videos into distinct categories, such as Sport and Music Video, is crucial for multimedia understanding and retrieval, especially in an age where an immense volume of video content is constantly being generated. Traditional methods require video decompression to extract pixel-level features like color, texture, and motion, thereby increasing computational and storage demands. Moreover, these methods often suffer from performance degradation in low-quality videos. We present a novel approach that examines only the post-compression bitstream of a video to perform classification, eliminating the need for bitstream. We validate our approach using a custom-built data set comprising over 29,000 YouTube video clips, totaling 6,000 hours and spanning 11 distinct categories. Our preliminary evaluations indicate precision, accuracy, and recall rates well over 80%. The algorithm operates approximately 15,000 times faster than real-time for 30fps videos, outperforming traditional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm by six orders of magnitude.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07364">Hodge-Aware Contrastive Learning</a><br>
                Authors: Alexander Möllers, Alexander Immer, Vincent Fortuin, Elvin Isufi <br>
                Abstract: Simplicial complexes prove effective in modeling data with multiway dependencies, such as data defined along the edges of networks or within other higher-order structures. Their spectrum can be decomposed into three interpretable subspaces via the Hodge decomposition, resulting foundational in numerous applications. We leverage this decomposition to develop a contrastive self-supervised learning approach for processing simplicial data and generating embeddings that encapsulate specific spectral information.Specifically, we encode the pertinent data invariances through simplicial neural networks and devise augmentations that yield positive contrastive examples with suitable spectral properties for downstream tasks. Additionally, we reweight the significance of negative examples in the contrastive loss, considering the similarity of their Hodge components to the anchor. By encouraging a stronger separation among less similar instances, we obtain an embedding space that reflects the spectral properties of the data. The numerical results on two standard edge flow classification tasks show a superior performance even when compared to supervised learning techniques. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting a spectral perspective for contrastive learning with higher-order data.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07374">Beta quantile regression for robust estimation of uncertainty in the  presence of outliers</a><br>
                Authors: Haleh Akrami, Omar Zamzam, Anand Joshi, Sergul Aydore, Richard Leahy <br>
                Abstract: Quantile Regression (QR) can be used to estimate aleatoric uncertainty in deep neural networks and can generate prediction intervals. Quantifying uncertainty is particularly important in critical applications such as clinical diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in determining disease status and planning the appropriate treatment. The most common application of quantile regression models is in cases where the parametric likelihood cannot be specified. Although quantile regression is quite robust to outlier response observations, it can be sensitive to outlier covariate observations (features). Outlier features can compromise the performance of deep learning regression problems such as style translation, image reconstruction, and deep anomaly detection, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. To address this problem, we propose a robust solution for quantile regression that incorporates concepts from robust divergence. We compare the performance of our proposed method with (i) least trimmed quantile regression and (ii) robust regression based on the regularization of case-specific parameters in a simple real dataset in the presence of outlier. These methods have not been applied in a deep learning framework. We also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by applying it to a medical imaging translation task using diffusion models.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07382">Less is More for Long Document Summary Evaluation by LLMs</a><br>
                Authors: Yunshu Wu, Hayate Iso, Pouya Pezeshkpour, Nikita Bhutani, Estevam Hruschka <br>
                Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in summary evaluation tasks, yet they face challenges such as high computational costs and the Lost-in-the-Middle problem where important information in the middle of long documents is often overlooked. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel approach, Extract-then-Evaluate, which involves extracting key sentences from a long source document and then evaluating the summary by prompting LLMs. The results reveal that the proposed method not only significantly reduces evaluation costs but also exhibits a higher correlation with human evaluations. Furthermore, we provide practical recommendations for optimal document length and sentence extraction methods, contributing to the development of cost-effective yet more accurate methods for LLM-based text generation evaluation.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07384">An Interactive Framework for Profiling News Media Sources</a><br>
                Authors: Nikhil Mehta, Dan Goldwasser <br>
                Abstract: The recent rise of social media has led to the spread of large amounts of fake and biased news, content published with the intent to sway beliefs. While detecting and profiling the sources that spread this news is important to maintain a healthy society, it is challenging for automated systems. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for news media profiling. It combines the strengths of graph based news media profiling models, Pre-trained Large Language Models, and human insight to characterize the social context on social media. Experimental results show that with as little as 5 human interactions, our framework can rapidly detect fake and biased news media, even in the most challenging settings of emerging news events, where test data is unseen.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07387">VDialogUE: A Unified Evaluation Benchmark for Visually-grounded Dialogue</a><br>
                Authors: Yunshui Li, Binyuan Hui, Zhaochao Yin, Wanwei He, Run Luo, Yuxing Long, Min Yang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li <br>
                Abstract: Visually-grounded dialog systems, which integrate multiple modes of communication such as text and visual inputs, have become an increasingly popular area of investigation. However, the absence of a standardized evaluation framework poses a challenge in assessing the development of this field. To this end, we propose \textbf{VDialogUE}, a \textbf{V}isually-grounded \textbf{Dialog}ue benchmark for \textbf{U}nified \textbf{E}valuation. It defines five core multi-modal dialogue tasks and covers six datasets. Furthermore, in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance across all tasks, we developed a novel evaluation metric called VDscore, which is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process~(AHP) method. Additionally, we present a straightforward yet efficient baseline model, named \textbf{VISIT}~(\textbf{VIS}ually-grounded d\textbf{I}alog \textbf{T}ransformer), to promote the advancement of general multi-modal dialogue systems. It progressively builds its multi-modal foundation and dialogue capability via a two-stage pre-training strategy. We believe that the VDialogUE benchmark, along with the evaluation scripts and our baseline models, will accelerate the development of visually-grounded dialog systems and lead to the development of more sophisticated and effective pre-trained models.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07390">Unleashing the Power of Depth and Pose Estimation Neural Networks by  Designing Compatible Endoscopic Images</a><br>
                Authors: Junyang Wu, Yun Gu <br>
                Abstract: Deep learning models have witnessed depth and pose estimation framework on unannotated datasets as a effective pathway to succeed in endoscopic navigation. Most current techniques are dedicated to developing more advanced neural networks to improve the accuracy. However, existing methods ignore the special properties of endoscopic images, resulting in an inability to fully unleash the power of neural networks. In this study, we conduct a detail analysis of the properties of endoscopic images and improve the compatibility of images and neural networks, to unleash the power of current neural networks. First, we introcude the Mask Image Modelling (MIM) module, which inputs partial image information instead of complete image information, allowing the network to recover global information from partial pixel information. This enhances the network' s ability to perceive global information and alleviates the phenomenon of local overfitting in convolutional neural networks due to local artifacts. Second, we propose a lightweight neural network to enhance the endoscopic images, to explicitly improve the compatibility between images and neural networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on the three public datasets and one inhouse dataset, and the proposed modules improve baselines by a large margin. Furthermore, the enhanced images we proposed, which have higher network compatibility, can serve as an effective data augmentation method and they are able to extract more stable feature points in traditional feature point matching tasks and achieve outstanding performance.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07394">Nucleus-aware Self-supervised Pretraining Using Unpaired Image-to-image  Translation for Histopathology Images</a><br>
                Authors: Zhiyun Song, Penghui Du, Junpeng Yan, Kailu Li, Jianzhong Shou, Maode Lai, Yubo Fan, Yan Xu <br>
                Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining attempts to enhance model performance by obtaining effective features from unlabeled data, and has demonstrated its effectiveness in the field of histopathology images. Despite its success, few works concentrate on the extraction of nucleus-level information, which is essential for pathologic analysis. In this work, we propose a novel nucleus-aware self-supervised pretraining framework for histopathology images. The framework aims to capture the nuclear morphology and distribution information through unpaired image-to-image translation between histopathology images and pseudo mask images. The generation process is modulated by both conditional and stochastic style representations, ensuring the reality and diversity of the generated histopathology images for pretraining. Further, an instance segmentation guided strategy is employed to capture instance-level information. The experiments on 7 datasets show that the proposed pretraining method outperforms supervised ones on Kather classification, multiple instance learning, and 5 dense-prediction tasks with the transfer learning protocol, and yields superior results than other self-supervised approaches on 8 semi-supervised tasks.

                Authors: Pu Miao, Zeyao Du, Junlin Zhang <br>
                Abstract: Several prior studies have suggested that word frequency biases can cause the Bert model to learn indistinguishable sentence embeddings. Contrastive learning schemes such as SimCSE and ConSERT have already been adopted successfully in unsupervised sentence embedding to improve the quality of embeddings by reducing this bias. However, these methods still introduce new biases such as sentence length bias and false negative sample bias, that hinders model's ability to learn more fine-grained semantics. In this paper, we reexamine the challenges of contrastive sentence embedding learning from a debiasing perspective and argue that effectively eliminating the influence of various biases is crucial for learning high-quality sentence embeddings. We think all those biases are introduced by simple rules for constructing training data in contrastive learning and the key for contrastive learning sentence embedding is to mimic the distribution of training data in supervised machine learning in unsupervised way. We propose a novel contrastive framework for sentence embedding, termed DebCSE, which can eliminate the impact of these biases by an inverse propensity weighted sampling method to select high-quality positive and negative pairs according to both the surface and semantic similarity between sentences. Extensive experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS) benchmarks reveal that DebCSE significantly outperforms the latest state-of-the-art models with an average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 80.33% on BERTbase.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07398">Semantic Adversarial Attacks via Diffusion Models</a><br>
                Authors: Chenan Wang, Jinhao Duan, Chaowei Xiao, Edward Kim, Matthew Stamm, Kaidi Xu <br>
                Abstract: Traditional adversarial attacks concentrate on manipulating clean examples in the pixel space by adding adversarial perturbations. By contrast, semantic adversarial attacks focus on changing semantic attributes of clean examples, such as color, context, and features, which are more feasible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a framework to quickly generate a semantic adversarial attack by leveraging recent diffusion models since semantic information is included in the latent space of well-trained diffusion models. Then there are two variants of this framework: 1) the Semantic Transformation (ST) approach fine-tunes the latent space of the generated image and/or the diffusion model itself; 2) the Latent Masking (LM) approach masks the latent space with another target image and local backpropagation-based interpretation methods. Additionally, the ST approach can be applied in either white-box or black-box settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on CelebA-HQ and AFHQ datasets, and our framework demonstrates great fidelity, generalizability, and transferability compared to other baselines. Our approaches achieve approximately 100% attack success rate in multiple settings with the best FID as 36.61.

                Authors: Ziyu Guo, Weiqin Zhao, Shujun Wang, Lequan Yu <br>
                Abstract: In computation pathology, the pyramid structure of gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has recently been studied for capturing various information from individual cell interactions to tissue microenvironments. This hierarchical structure is believed to be beneficial for cancer diagnosis and prognosis tasks. However, most previous hierarchical WSI analysis works (1) only characterize local or global correlations within the WSI pyramids and (2) use only unidirectional interaction between different resolutions, leading to an incomplete picture of WSI pyramids. To this end, this paper presents a novel Hierarchical Interaction Graph-Transformer (i.e., HIGT) for WSI analysis. With Graph Neural Network and Transformer as the building commons, HIGT can learn both short-range local information and long-range global representation of the WSI pyramids. Considering that the information from different resolutions is complementary and can benefit each other during the learning process, we further design a novel Bidirectional Interaction block to establish communication between different levels within the WSI pyramids. Finally, we aggregate both coarse-grained and fine-grained features learned from different levels together for slide-level prediction. We evaluate our methods on two public WSI datasets from TCGA projects, i.e., kidney carcinoma (KICA) and esophageal carcinoma (ESCA). Experimental results show that our HIGT outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical state-of-the-art methods on both tumor subtyping and staging tasks.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07402">Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation on Graphs with Contrastive Learning  and Minimax Entropy</a><br>
                Authors: Jiaren Xiao, Quanyu Dai, Xiao Shen, Xiaochen Xie, Jing Dai, James Lam, Ka-Wai Kwok <br>
                Abstract: Label scarcity in a graph is frequently encountered in real-world applications due to the high cost of data labeling. To this end, semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) on graphs aims to leverage the knowledge of a labeled source graph to aid in node classification on a target graph with limited labels. SSDA tasks need to overcome the domain gap between the source and target graphs. However, to date, this challenging research problem has yet to be formally considered by the existing approaches designed for cross-graph node classification. To tackle the SSDA problem on graphs, a novel method called SemiGCL is proposed, which benefits from graph contrastive learning and minimax entropy training. SemiGCL generates informative node representations by contrasting the representations learned from a graph's local and global views. Additionally, SemiGCL is adversarially optimized with the entropy loss of unlabeled target nodes to reduce domain divergence. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemiGCL outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on the SSDA tasks.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07403">Flexible Visual Recognition by Evidential Modeling of Confusion and  Ignorance</a><br>
                Authors: Lei Fan, Bo Liu, Haoxiang Li, Ying Wu, Gang Hua <br>
                Abstract: In real-world scenarios, typical visual recognition systems could fail under two major causes, i.e., the misclassification between known classes and the excusable misbehavior on unknown-class images. To tackle these deficiencies, flexible visual recognition should dynamically predict multiple classes when they are unconfident between choices and reject making predictions when the input is entirely out of the training distribution. Two challenges emerge along with this novel task. First, prediction uncertainty should be separately quantified as confusion depicting inter-class uncertainties and ignorance identifying out-of-distribution samples. Second, both confusion and ignorance should be comparable between samples to enable effective decision-making. In this paper, we propose to model these two sources of uncertainty explicitly with the theory of Subjective Logic. Regarding recognition as an evidence-collecting process, confusion is then defined as conflicting evidence, while ignorance is the absence of evidence. By predicting Dirichlet concentration parameters for singletons, comprehensive subjective opinions, including confusion and ignorance, could be achieved via further evidence combinations. Through a series of experiments on synthetic data analysis, visual recognition, and open-set detection, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in quantifying two sources of uncertainties and dealing with flexible recognition.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07409">Masked Diffusion with Task-awareness for Procedure Planning in  Instructional Videos</a><br>
                Authors: Fen Fang, Yun Liu, Ali Koksal, Qianli Xu, Joo-Hwee Lim <br>
                Abstract: A key challenge with procedure planning in instructional videos lies in how to handle a large decision space consisting of a multitude of action types that belong to various tasks. To understand real-world video content, an AI agent must proficiently discern these action types (e.g., pour milk, pour water, open lid, close lid, etc.) based on brief visual observation. Moreover, it must adeptly capture the intricate semantic relation of the action types and task goals, along with the variable action sequences. Recently, notable progress has been made via the integration of diffusion models and visual representation learning to address the challenge. However, existing models employ rudimentary mechanisms to utilize task information to manage the decision space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a simple yet effective enhancement - a masked diffusion model. The introduced mask acts akin to a task-oriented attention filter, enabling the diffusion/denoising process to concentrate on a subset of action types. Furthermore, to bolster the accuracy of task classification, we harness more potent visual representation learning techniques. In particular, we learn a joint visual-text embedding, where a text embedding is generated by prompting a pre-trained vision-language model to focus on human actions. We evaluate the method on three public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.

                Abstract: In recent studies, linear recurrent neural networks (LRNNs) have achieved Transformer-level performance in natural language modeling and long-range modeling while offering rapid parallel training and constant inference costs. With the resurged interest in LRNNs, we study whether they can learn the hidden rules in training sequences, such as the grammatical structures of regular language. We theoretically analyze some existing LRNNs and discover their limitations on regular language. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a new LRNN equipped with a block-diagonal and input-dependent transition matrix. Experiments suggest that the proposed model is the only LRNN that can perform length extrapolation on regular language tasks such as Sum, Even Pair, and Modular Arithmetic.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07413">CPPF: A contextual and post-processing-free model for automatic speech  recognition</a><br>

                Abstract: ASR systems have become increasingly widespread in recent years. However, their textual outputs often require post-processing tasks before they can be practically utilized. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs and Whisper, and focus on integrating multiple ASR text processing tasks related to speech recognition into the ASR model. This integration not only shortens the multi-stage pipeline, but also prevents the propagation of cascading errors, resulting in direct generation of post-processed text. In this study, we focus on ASR-related processing tasks, including Contextual ASR and multiple ASR post processing tasks. To achieve this objective, we introduce the CPPF model, which offers a versatile and highly effective alternative to ASR processing. CPPF seamlessly integrates these tasks without any significant loss in recognition performance.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07423">ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but not Low-) Resource Languages</a><br>
                Authors: Nathaniel R. Robinson, Perez Ogayo, David R. Mortensen, Graham Neubig <br>
                Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs' MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world's diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language's resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT's relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07425">JSMNet Improving Indoor Point Cloud Semantic and Instance Segmentation  through Self-Attention and Multiscale</a><br>
                Authors: Shuochen Xu, Zhenxin Zhang <br>
                Abstract: The semantic understanding of indoor 3D point cloud data is crucial for a range of subsequent applications, including indoor service robots, navigation systems, and digital twin engineering. Global features are crucial for achieving high-quality semantic and instance segmentation of indoor point clouds, as they provide essential long-range context information. To this end, we propose JSMNet, which combines a multi-layer network with a global feature self-attention module to jointly segment three-dimensional point cloud semantics and instances. To better express the characteristics of indoor targets, we have designed a multi-resolution feature adaptive fusion module that takes into account the differences in point cloud density caused by varying scanner distances from the target. Additionally, we propose a framework for joint semantic and instance segmentation by integrating semantic and instance features to achieve superior results. We conduct experiments on S3DIS, which is a large three-dimensional indoor point cloud dataset. Our proposed method is compared against other methods, and the results show that it outperforms existing methods in semantic and instance segmentation and provides better results in target local area segmentation. Specifically, our proposed method outperforms PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a) by 16.0% and 26.3% in terms of semantic segmentation mIoU in S3DIS (Area 5) and instance segmentation mPre, respectively.

                Abstract: Backdoor attack aims to compromise a model, which returns an adversary-wanted output when a specific trigger pattern appears yet behaves normally for clean inputs. Current backdoor attacks require changing pixels of clean images, which results in poor stealthiness of attacks and increases the difficulty of the physical implementation. This paper proposes a novel physical invisible backdoor based on camera imaging without changing nature image pixels. Specifically, a compromised model returns a target label for images taken by a particular camera, while it returns correct results for other images. To implement and evaluate the proposed backdoor, we take shots of different objects from multi-angles using multiple smartphones to build a new dataset of 21,500 images. Conventional backdoor attacks work ineffectively with some classical models, such as ResNet18, over the above-mentioned dataset. Therefore, we propose a three-step training strategy to mount the backdoor attack. First, we design and train a camera identification model with the phone IDs to extract the camera fingerprint feature. Subsequently, we elaborate a special network architecture, which is easily compromised by our backdoor attack, by leveraging the attributes of the CFA interpolation algorithm and combining it with the feature extraction block in the camera identification model. Finally, we transfer the backdoor from the elaborated special network architecture to the classical architecture model via teacher-student distillation learning. Since the trigger of our method is related to the specific phone, our attack works effectively in the physical world. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach and robustness against various backdoor defenses.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07429">Semantic Parsing in Limited Resource Conditions</a><br>
                Authors: Zhuang Li <br>
                Abstract: This thesis explores challenges in semantic parsing, specifically focusing on scenarios with limited data and computational resources. It offers solutions using techniques like automatic data curation, knowledge transfer, active learning, and continual learning. For tasks with no parallel training data, the thesis proposes generating synthetic training examples from structured database schemas. When there is abundant data in a source domain but limited parallel data in a target domain, knowledge from the source is leveraged to improve parsing in the target domain. For multilingual situations with limited data in the target languages, the thesis introduces a method to adapt parsers using a limited human translation budget. Active learning is applied to select source-language samples for manual translation, maximizing parser performance in the target language. In addition, an alternative method is also proposed to utilize machine translation services, supplemented by human-translated data, to train a more effective parser. When computational resources are limited, a continual learning approach is introduced to minimize training time and computational memory. This maintains the parser's efficiency in previously learned tasks while adapting it to new tasks, mitigating the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Overall, the thesis provides a comprehensive set of methods to improve semantic parsing in resource-constrained conditions.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07430">Clinical Text Summarization: Adapting Large Language Models Can  Outperform Human Experts</a><br>

                Abstract: Sifting through vast textual data and summarizing key information imposes a substantial burden on how clinicians allocate their time. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown immense promise in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their efficacy across diverse clinical summarization tasks has not yet been rigorously examined. In this work, we employ domain adaptation methods on eight LLMs, spanning six datasets and four distinct summarization tasks: radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes, and doctor-patient dialogue. Our thorough quantitative assessment reveals trade-offs between models and adaptation methods in addition to instances where recent advances in LLMs may not lead to improved results. Further, in a clinical reader study with six physicians, we depict that summaries from the best adapted LLM are preferable to human summaries in terms of completeness and correctness. Our ensuing qualitative analysis delineates mutual challenges faced by both LLMs and human experts. Lastly, we correlate traditional quantitative NLP metrics with reader study scores to enhance our understanding of how these metrics align with physician preferences. Our research marks the first evidence of LLMs outperforming human experts in clinical text summarization across multiple tasks. This implies that integrating LLMs into clinical workflows could alleviate documentation burden, empowering clinicians to focus more on personalized patient care and other irreplaceable human aspects of medicine.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07438">Towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in the Internet of Things  (IoT): Opportunities and Challenges</a><br>

                Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), possessing the capacity to comprehend, learn, and execute tasks with human cognitive abilities, engenders significant anticipation and intrigue across scientific, commercial, and societal arenas. This fascination extends particularly to the Internet of Things (IoT), a landscape characterized by the interconnection of countless devices, sensors, and systems, collectively gathering and sharing data to enable intelligent decision-making and automation. This research embarks on an exploration of the opportunities and challenges towards achieving AGI in the context of the IoT. Specifically, it starts by outlining the fundamental principles of IoT and the critical role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IoT systems. Subsequently, it delves into AGI fundamentals, culminating in the formulation of a conceptual framework for AGI's seamless integration within IoT. The application spectrum for AGI-infused IoT is broad, encompassing domains ranging from smart grids, residential environments, manufacturing, and transportation to environmental monitoring, agriculture, healthcare, and education. However, adapting AGI to resource-constrained IoT settings necessitates dedicated research efforts. Furthermore, the paper addresses constraints imposed by limited computing resources, intricacies associated with large-scale IoT communication, as well as the critical concerns pertaining to security and privacy.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07439">DePT: Decoupled Prompt Tuning</a><br>
                Authors: Ji Zhang, Shihan Wu, Lianli Gao, Hengtao Shen, Jingkuan Song <br>
                Abstract: This work breaks through the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT)dilemma in prompt tuning, i.e., the better the tuned model generalizes to the base (or target) task, the worse it generalizes to new tasks, and vice versa. Specifically, through an in-depth analysis of the learned features of the base and new tasks, we observe that the BNT stems from a channel bias issue, i.e., the vast majority of feature channels are occupied by base-specific knowledge, resulting in the collapse of taskshared knowledge important to new tasks. To address this, we propose the Decoupled Prompt Tuning (DePT) framework, which decouples base-specific knowledge from feature channels into an isolated feature space during prompt tuning, so as to maximally preserve task-shared knowledge in the original feature space for achieving better zero-shot generalization on new tasks. Importantly, our DePT is orthogonal to existing prompt tuning methods, hence it can improve all of them. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show the strong flexibility and effectiveness of DePT. Our code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Koorye/DePT.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07444">Research on self-cross transformer model of point cloud change detecter</a><br>
                Authors: Xiaoxu Ren, Haili Sun, Zhenxin Zhang <br>
                Abstract: With the vigorous development of the urban construction industry, engineering deformation or changes often occur during the construction process. To combat this phenomenon, it is necessary to detect changes in order to detect construction loopholes in time, ensure the integrity of the project and reduce labor costs. Or the inconvenience and injuriousness of the road. In the study of change detection in 3D point clouds, researchers have published various research methods on 3D point clouds. Directly based on but mostly based ontraditional threshold distance methods (C2C, M3C2, M3C2-EP), and some are to convert 3D point clouds into DSM, which loses a lot of original information. Although deep learning is used in remote sensing methods, in terms of change detection of 3D point clouds, it is more converted into two-dimensional patches, and neural networks are rarely applied directly. We prefer that the network is given at the level of pixels or points. Variety. Therefore, in this article, our network builds a network for 3D point cloud change detection, and proposes a new module Cross transformer suitable for change detection. Simultaneously simulate tunneling data for change detection, and do test experiments with our network.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07445">SIB-200: A Simple, Inclusive, and Big Evaluation Dataset for Topic  Classification in 200+ Languages and Dialects</a><br>
                Authors: David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Hannah Liu, Xiaoyu Shen, Nikita Vassilyev, Jesujoba O. Alabi, Yanke Mao, Haonan Gao, Annie En-Shiun Lee <br>
                Abstract: Despite the progress we have recorded in the last few years in multilingual natural language processing, evaluation is typically limited to a small set of languages with available datasets which excludes a large number of low-resource languages. In this paper, we created SIB-200 -- a large-scale open-sourced benchmark dataset for topic classification in 200 languages and dialects to address the lack of evaluation dataset for Natural Language Understanding (NLU). For many of the languages covered in SIB-200, this is the first publicly available evaluation dataset for NLU. The dataset is based on Flores-200 machine translation corpus. We annotated the English portion of the dataset and extended the sentence-level annotation to the remaining 203 languages covered in the corpus. Despite the simplicity of this task, our evaluation in full-supervised setting, cross-lingual transfer setting and prompting of large language model setting show that there is still a large gap between the performance of high-resource and low-resource languages when multilingual evaluation is scaled to numerous world languages. We found that languages unseen during the pre-training of multilingual language models, under-represented language families (like Nilotic and Altantic-Congo), and languages from the regions of Africa, Americas, Oceania and South East Asia, often have the lowest performance on our topic classification dataset. We hope our dataset will encourage a more inclusive evaluation of multilingual language models on a more diverse set of languages. https://github.com/dadelani/sib-200<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07450">TensorFlow Chaotic Prediction and Blow Up</a><br>
                Authors: M. Andrecut <br>
                Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of chaotic systems is one of the most challenging tasks for neural networks, and machine learning in general. Here we aim to predict the spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics of a high-dimensional non-linear system. In our attempt we use the TensorFlow library, representing the state of the art for deep neural networks training and prediction. While our results are encouraging, and show that the dynamics of the considered system can be predicted for short time, we also indirectly discovered an unexpected and undesirable behavior of the TensorFlow library. More specifically, the longer term prediction of the system's chaotic behavior quickly deteriorates and blows up due to the nondeterministic behavior of the TensorFlow library. Here we provide numerical evidence of the short time prediction ability, and of the longer term predictability blow up.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07452">Is Solving Graph Neural Tangent Kernel Equivalent to Training Graph  Neural Network?</a><br>
                Authors: Lianke Qin, Zhao Song, Baocheng Sun <br>
                Abstract: A rising trend in theoretical deep learning is to understand why deep learning works through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) [jgh18], a kernel method that is equivalent to using gradient descent to train a multi-layer infinitely-wide neural network. NTK is a major step forward in the theoretical deep learning because it allows researchers to use traditional mathematical tools to analyze properties of deep neural networks and to explain various neural network techniques from a theoretical view. A natural extension of NTK on graph learning is \textit{Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK)}, and researchers have already provide GNTK formulation for graph-level regression and show empirically that this kernel method can achieve similar accuracy as GNNs on various bioinformatics datasets [dhs+19]. The remaining question now is whether solving GNTK regression is equivalent to training an infinite-wide multi-layer GNN using gradient descent. In this paper, we provide three new theoretical results. First, we formally prove this equivalence for graph-level regression. Second, we present the first GNTK formulation for node-level regression. Finally, we prove the equivalence for node-level regression.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07462">Are Large Language Model-based Evaluators the Solution to Scaling Up  Multilingual Evaluation?</a><br>
                Authors: Rishav Hada, Varun Gumma, Adrian de Wynter, Harshita Diddee, Mohamed Ahmed, Monojit Choudhury, Kalika Bali, Sunayana Sitaram <br>
                Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Question Answering, Summarization, and Classification. The use of LLMs as evaluators, that can rank or score the output of other models (usually LLMs) has become increasingly popular, due to the limitations of current evaluation techniques including the lack of appropriate benchmarks, metrics, cost, and access to human annotators. While LLMs are capable of handling approximately 100 languages, the majority of languages beyond the top 20 lack systematic evaluation across various tasks, metrics, and benchmarks. This creates an urgent need to scale up multilingual evaluation to ensure a precise understanding of LLM performance across diverse languages. LLM-based evaluators seem like the perfect solution to this problem, as they do not require human annotators, human-created references, or benchmarks and can theoretically be used to evaluate any language covered by the LLM. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based evaluators can help scale up multilingual evaluation. Specifically, we calibrate LLM-based evaluation against 20k human judgments of five metrics across three text-generation tasks in eight languages. Our findings indicate that LLM-based evaluators may exhibit bias towards higher scores and should be used with caution and should always be calibrated with a dataset of native speaker judgments, particularly in low-resource and non-Latin script languages.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07471">EP2P-Loc: End-to-End 3D Point to 2D Pixel Localization for Large-Scale  Visual Localization</a><br>
                Authors: Minjung Kim, Junseo Koo, Gunhee Kim <br>
                Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a 6-DoF camera pose of a query image within a provided 3D reference map. Thanks to recent advances in various 3D sensors, 3D point clouds are becoming a more accurate and affordable option for building the reference map, but research to match the points of 3D point clouds with pixels in 2D images for visual localization remains challenging. Existing approaches that jointly learn 2D-3D feature matching suffer from low inliers due to representational differences between the two modalities, and the methods that bypass this problem into classification have an issue of poor refinement. In this work, we propose EP2P-Loc, a novel large-scale visual localization method that mitigates such appearance discrepancy and enables end-to-end training for pose estimation. To increase the number of inliers, we propose a simple algorithm to remove invisible 3D points in the image, and find all 2D-3D correspondences without keypoint detection. To reduce memory usage and search complexity, we take a coarse-to-fine approach where we extract patch-level features from 2D images, then perform 2D patch classification on each 3D point, and obtain the exact corresponding 2D pixel coordinates through positional encoding. Finally, for the first time in this task, we employ a differentiable PnP for end-to-end training. In the experiments on newly curated large-scale indoor and outdoor benchmarks based on 2D-3D-S and KITTI, we show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing visual localization and image-to-point cloud registration methods.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07478">Direct Text to Speech Translation System using Acoustic Units</a><br>
                Authors: Victoria Mingote, Pablo Gimeno, Luis Vicente, Sameer Khurana, Antoine Laurent, Jarod Duret <br>
                Abstract: This paper proposes a direct text to speech translation system using discrete acoustic units. This framework employs text in different source languages as input to generate speech in the target language without the need for text transcriptions in this language. Motivated by the success of acoustic units in previous works for direct speech to speech translation systems, we use the same pipeline to extract the acoustic units using a speech encoder combined with a clustering algorithm. Once units are obtained, an encoder-decoder architecture is trained to predict them. Then a vocoder generates speech from units. Our approach for direct text to speech translation was tested on the new CVSS corpus with two different text mBART models employed as initialisation. The systems presented report competitive performance for most of the language pairs evaluated. Besides, results show a remarkable improvement when initialising our proposed architecture with a model pre-trained with more languages.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07481">Improved Auto-Encoding using Deterministic Projected Belief Networks</a><br>
                Authors: Paul M Baggenstoss <br>
                Abstract: In this paper, we exploit the unique properties of a deterministic projected belief network (D-PBN) to take full advantage of trainable compound activation functions (TCAs). A D-PBN is a type of auto-encoder that operates by "backing up" through a feed-forward neural network. TCAs are activation functions with complex monotonic-increasing shapes that change the distribution of the data so that the linear transformation that follows is more effective. Because a D-PBN operates by "backing up", the TCAs are inverted in the reconstruction process, restoring the original distribution of the data, thus taking advantage of a given TCA in both analysis and reconstruction. In this paper, we show that a D-PBN auto-encoder with TCAs can significantly out-perform standard auto-encoders including variational auto-encoders.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07495">HDTR-Net: A Real-Time High-Definition Teeth Restoration Network for  Arbitrary Talking Face Generation Methods</a><br>
                Authors: Yongyuan Li, Xiuyuan Qin, Chao Liang, Mingqiang Wei <br>
                Abstract: Talking Face Generation (TFG) aims to reconstruct facial movements to achieve high natural lip movements from audio and facial features that are under potential connections. Existing TFG methods have made significant advancements to produce natural and realistic images. However, most work rarely takes visual quality into consideration. It is challenging to ensure lip synchronization while avoiding visual quality degradation in cross-modal generation methods. To address this issue, we propose a universal High-Definition Teeth Restoration Network, dubbed HDTR-Net, for arbitrary TFG methods. HDTR-Net can enhance teeth regions at an extremely fast speed while maintaining synchronization, and temporal consistency. In particular, we propose a Fine-Grained Feature Fusion (FGFF) module to effectively capture fine texture feature information around teeth and surrounding regions, and use these features to fine-grain the feature map to enhance the clarity of teeth. Extensive experiments show that our method can be adapted to arbitrary TFG methods without suffering from lip synchronization and frame coherence. Another advantage of HDTR-Net is its real-time generation ability. Also under the condition of high-definition restoration of talking face video synthesis, its inference speed is $300\%$ faster than the current state-of-the-art face restoration based on super-resolution.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07499">Efficiently Robustify Pre-trained Models</a><br>
                Authors: Nishant Jain, Harkirat Behl, Yogesh Singh Rawat, Vibhav Vineet <br>
                Abstract: A recent trend in deep learning algorithms has been towards training large scale models, having high parameter count and trained on big dataset. However, robustness of such large scale models towards real-world settings is still a less-explored topic. In this work, we first benchmark the performance of these models under different perturbations and datasets thereby representing real-world shifts, and highlight their degrading performance under these shifts. We then discuss on how complete model fine-tuning based existing robustification schemes might not be a scalable option given very large scale networks and can also lead them to forget some of the desired characterstics. Finally, we propose a simple and cost-effective method to solve this problem, inspired by knowledge transfer literature. It involves robustifying smaller models, at a lower computation cost, and then use them as teachers to tune a fraction of these large scale networks, reducing the overall computational overhead. We evaluate our proposed method under various vision perturbations including ImageNet-C,R,S,A datasets and also for transfer learning, zero-shot evaluation setups on different datasets. Benchmark results show that our method is able to induce robustness to these large scale models efficiently, requiring significantly lower time and also preserves the transfer learning, zero-shot properties of the original model which none of the existing methods are able to achieve.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07509">DiffTalker: Co-driven audio-image diffusion for talking faces via  intermediate landmarks</a><br>
                Authors: Zipeng Qi, Xulong Zhang, Ning Cheng, Jing Xiao, Jianzong Wang <br>
                Abstract: Generating realistic talking faces is a complex and widely discussed task with numerous applications. In this paper, we present DiffTalker, a novel model designed to generate lifelike talking faces through audio and landmark co-driving. DiffTalker addresses the challenges associated with directly applying diffusion models to audio control, which are traditionally trained on text-image pairs. DiffTalker consists of two agent networks: a transformer-based landmarks completion network for geometric accuracy and a diffusion-based face generation network for texture details. Landmarks play a pivotal role in establishing a seamless connection between the audio and image domains, facilitating the incorporation of knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models. This innovative approach efficiently produces articulate-speaking faces. Experimental results showcase DiffTalker's superior performance in producing clear and geometrically accurate talking faces, all without the need for additional alignment between audio and image features.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07513">RecycleNet: Latent Feature Recycling Leads to Iterative Decision  Refinement</a><br>
                Authors: Gregor Koehler, Tassilo Wald, Constantin Ulrich, David Zimmerer, Paul F. Jaeger, Jörg K.H. Franke, Simon Kohl, Fabian Isensee, Klaus H. Maier-Hein <br>
                Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of deep learning systems over the last decade, a key difference still remains between neural network and human decision-making: As humans, we cannot only form a decision on the spot, but also ponder, revisiting an initial guess from different angles, distilling relevant information, arriving at a better decision. Here, we propose RecycleNet, a latent feature recycling method, instilling the pondering capability for neural networks to refine initial decisions over a number of recycling steps, where outputs are fed back into earlier network layers in an iterative fashion. This approach makes minimal assumptions about the neural network architecture and thus can be implemented in a wide variety of contexts. Using medical image segmentation as the evaluation environment, we show that latent feature recycling enables the network to iteratively refine initial predictions even beyond the iterations seen during training, converging towards an improved decision. We evaluate this across a variety of segmentation benchmarks and show consistent improvements even compared with top-performing segmentation methods. This allows trading increased computation time for improved performance, which can be beneficial, especially for safety-critical applications.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07515">Dhan-Shomadhan: A Dataset of Rice Leaf Disease Classification for  Bangladeshi Local Rice</a><br>

                Authors: Yujie Feng, Yin Yang, Xiaohong Fan, Zhengpeng Zhang, Jianping Zhang <br>
                Abstract: Remote sensing images are essential for many earth science applications, but their quality can be degraded due to limitations in sensor technology and complex imaging environments. To address this, various remote sensing image deblurring methods have been developed to restore sharp, high-quality images from degraded observational data. However, most traditional model-based deblurring methods usually require predefined hand-craft prior assumptions, which are difficult to handle in complex applications, and most deep learning-based deblurring methods are designed as a black box, lacking transparency and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel blind deblurring learning framework based on alternating iterations of shrinkage thresholds, alternately updating blurring kernels and images, with the theoretical foundation of network design. Additionally, we propose a learnable blur kernel proximal mapping module to improve the blur kernel evaluation in the kernel domain. Then, we proposed a deep proximal mapping module in the image domain, which combines a generalized shrinkage threshold operator and a multi-scale prior feature extraction block. This module also introduces an attention mechanism to adaptively adjust the prior importance, thus avoiding the drawbacks of hand-crafted image prior terms. Thus, a novel multi-scale generalized shrinkage threshold network (MGSTNet) is designed to specifically focus on learning deep geometric prior features to enhance image restoration. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our MGSTNet framework on remote sensing image datasets compared to existing deblurring methods.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07526">Learning Beyond Similarities: Incorporating Dissimilarities between  Positive Pairs in Self-Supervised Time Series Learning</a><br>
                Authors: Adrian Atienza, Jakob Bardram, Sadasivan Puthusserypady <br>
                Abstract: By identifying similarities between successive inputs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for time series analysis have demonstrated their effectiveness in encoding the inherent static characteristics of temporal data. However, an exclusive emphasis on similarities might result in representations that overlook the dynamic attributes critical for modeling cardiovascular diseases within a confined subject cohort. Introducing Distilled Encoding Beyond Similarities (DEBS), this paper pioneers an SSL approach that transcends mere similarities by integrating dissimilarities among positive pairs. The framework is applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, leading to a notable enhancement of +10\% in the detection accuracy of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) across diverse subjects. DEBS underscores the potential of attaining a more refined representation by encoding the dynamic characteristics of time series data, tapping into dissimilarities during the optimization process. Broadly, the strategy delineated in this study holds the promise of unearthing novel avenues for advancing SSL methodologies tailored to temporal data.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07530">Adaptive approximation of monotone functions</a><br>
                Authors: Pierre Gaillard (Thoth), Sébastien Gerchinovitz (IMT), Étienne de Montbrun (TSE-R) <br>
                Abstract: We study the classical problem of approximating a non-decreasing function $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ in $L^p(\mu)$ norm by sequentially querying its values, for known compact real intervals $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and a known probability measure $\mu$ on $\cX$. For any function~$f$ we characterize the minimum number of evaluations of $f$ that algorithms need to guarantee an approximation $\hat{f}$ with an $L^p(\mu)$ error below $\epsilon$ after stopping. Unlike worst-case results that hold uniformly over all $f$, our complexity measure is dependent on each specific function $f$. To address this problem, we introduce GreedyBox, a generalization of an algorithm originally proposed by Novak (1992) for numerical integration. We prove that GreedyBox achieves an optimal sample complexity for any function $f$, up to logarithmic factors. Additionally, we uncover results regarding piecewise-smooth functions. Perhaps as expected, the $L^p(\mu)$ error of GreedyBox decreases much faster for piecewise-$C^2$ functions than predicted by the algorithm (without any knowledge on the smoothness of $f$). A simple modification even achieves optimal minimax approximation rates for such functions, which we compute explicitly. In particular, our findings highlight multiple performance gaps between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, smooth and piecewise-smooth functions, as well as monotone or non-monotone functions. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical results.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07537">Universality of underlying mechanism for successful deep learning</a><br>
                Authors: Yuval Meir, Yarden Tzach, Shiri Hodassman, Ofek Tevet, Ido Kanter <br>
                Abstract: An underlying mechanism for successful deep learning (DL) with a limited deep architecture and dataset, namely VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, was recently presented based on a quantitative method to measure the quality of a single filter in each layer. In this method, each filter identifies small clusters of possible output labels, with additional noise selected as labels out of the clusters. This feature is progressively sharpened with the layers, resulting in an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and higher accuracy. In this study, the suggested universal mechanism is verified for VGG-16 and EfficientNet-B0 trained on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets with the following main results. First, the accuracy progressively increases with the layers, whereas the noise per filter typically progressively decreases. Second, for a given deep architecture, the maximal error rate increases approximately linearly with the number of output labels. Third, the average filter cluster size and the number of clusters per filter at the last convolutional layer adjacent to the output layer are almost independent of the number of dataset labels in the range [3, 1,000], while a high SNR is preserved. The presented DL mechanism suggests several techniques, such as applying filter's cluster connections (AFCC), to improve the computational complexity and accuracy of deep architectures and furthermore pinpoints the simplification of pre-existing structures while maintaining their accuracies.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07544">VerilogEval: Evaluating Large Language Models for Verilog Code  Generation</a><br>
                Authors: Mingjie Liu, Nathaniel Pinckney, Brucek Khailany, Haoxing Ren <br>
                Abstract: The increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for their application in diverse domains. This paper proposes a benchmarking framework tailored specifically for evaluating LLM performance in the context of Verilog code generation for hardware design and verification. We present a comprehensive evaluation dataset consisting of 156 problems from the Verilog instructional website HDLBits. The evaluation set consists of a diverse set of Verilog code generation tasks, ranging from simple combinational circuits to complex finite state machines. The Verilog code completions can be automatically tested for functional correctness by comparing the transient simulation outputs of the generated design with a golden solution. We also demonstrate that the Verilog code generation capability of pretrained language models could be improved with supervised fine-tuning by bootstrapping with LLM generated synthetic problem-code pairs.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07545">DBLPLink: An Entity Linker for the DBLP Scholarly Knowledge Graph</a><br>
                Authors: Debayan Banerjee, Arefa, Ricardo Usbeck, Chris Biemann <br>
                Abstract: In this work, we present a web application named DBLPLink, which performs entity linking over the DBLP scholarly knowledge graph. DBLPLink uses text-to-text pre-trained language models, such as T5, to produce entity label spans from an input text question. Entity candidates are fetched from a database based on the labels, and an entity re-ranker sorts them based on entity embeddings, such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx. The results are displayed so that users may compare and contrast the results between T5-small, T5-base and the different KG embeddings used. The demo can be accessed at https://ltdemos.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/dblplink/.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07561">Adaptive Prompt Learning with Distilled Connective Knowledge for  Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition</a><br>
                Authors: Bang Wang, Zhenglin Wang, Wei Xiang, Yijun Mo <br>
                Abstract: Implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) aims at recognizing the discourse relation between two text segments without an explicit connective. Recently, the prompt learning has just been applied to the IDRR task with great performance improvements over various neural network-based approaches. However, the discrete nature of the state-art-of-art prompting approach requires manual design of templates and answers, a big hurdle for its practical applications. In this paper, we propose a continuous version of prompt learning together with connective knowledge distillation, called AdaptPrompt, to reduce manual design efforts via continuous prompting while further improving performance via knowledge transfer. In particular, we design and train a few virtual tokens to form continuous templates and automatically select the most suitable one by gradient search in the embedding space. We also design an answer-relation mapping rule to generate a few virtual answers as the answer space. Furthermore, we notice the importance of annotated connectives in the training dataset and design a teacher-student architecture for knowledge transfer. Experiments on the up-to-date PDTB Corpus V3.0 validate our design objectives in terms of the better relation recognition performance over the state-of-the-art competitors.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07578">Equivariant Data Augmentation for Generalization in Offline  Reinforcement Learning</a><br>
                Authors: Cristina Pinneri, Sarah Bechtle, Markus Wulfmeier, Arunkumar Byravan, Jingwei Zhang, William F. Whitney, Martin Riedmiller <br>
                Abstract: We present a novel approach to address the challenge of generalization in offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the agent learns from a fixed dataset without any additional interaction with the environment. Specifically, we aim to improve the agent's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution goals. To achieve this, we propose to learn a dynamics model and check if it is equivariant with respect to a fixed type of transformation, namely translations in the state space. We then use an entropy regularizer to increase the equivariant set and augment the dataset with the resulting transformed samples. Finally, we learn a new policy offline based on the augmented dataset, with an off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach can greatly improve the test performance of the policy on the considered environments.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07579">Structure-Preserving Transformers for Sequences of SPD Matrices</a><br>
                Authors: Mathieu Seraphim, Alexis Lechervy, Florian Yger, Luc Brun, Olivier Etard <br>
                Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based auto-attention mechanisms have been successfully applied to the analysis of a variety of context-reliant data types, from texts to images and beyond, including data from non-Euclidean geometries. In this paper, we present such a mechanism, designed to classify sequences of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices while preserving their Riemannian geometry throughout the analysis. We apply our method to automatic sleep staging on timeseries of EEG-derived covariance matrices from a standard dataset, obtaining high levels of stage-wise performance.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07590">Revisiting Supertagging for HPSG</a><br>
                Authors: Olga Zamaraeva, Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez <br>
                Abstract: We present new supertaggers trained on HPSG-based treebanks. These treebanks feature high-quality annotation based on a well-developed linguistic theory and include diverse and challenging test datasets, beyond the usual WSJ section 23 and Wikipedia data. HPSG supertagging has previously relied on MaxEnt-based models. We use SVM and neural CRF- and BERT-based methods and show that both SVM and neural supertaggers achieve considerably higher accuracy compared to the baseline. Our fine-tuned BERT-based tagger achieves 97.26% accuracy on 1000 sentences from WSJ23 and 93.88% on the completely out-of-domain The Cathedral and the Bazaar (cb)). We conclude that it therefore makes sense to integrate these new supertaggers into modern HPSG parsers, and we also hope that the diverse and difficult datasets we used here will gain more popularity in the field. We contribute the complete dataset reformatted for token classification.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07593">Statistically Valid Variable Importance Assessment through Conditional  Permutations</a><br>

Engemann (4), Bertrand Thirion (1 and 2 and 3) ((1) Inria, (2) Universite Paris Saclay, (3) CEA, (4) Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Neuroscience and Rare Diseases, Roche Innovation Center Basel, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) <br>
                Abstract: Variable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control. When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results suggest that $\textit{CPI}$ can be readily used as drop-in replacement for permutation-based methods.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07594">Neuro-Symbolic Recommendation Model based on Logic Query</a><br>
                Authors: Maonian Wu, Bang Chen, Shaojun Zhu, Bo Zheng, Wei Peng, Mingyi Zhang <br>
                Abstract: A recommendation system assists users in finding items that are relevant to them. Existing recommendation models are primarily based on predicting relationships between users and items and use complex matching models or incorporate extensive external information to capture association patterns in data. However, recommendation is not only a problem of inductive statistics using data; it is also a cognitive task of reasoning decisions based on knowledge extracted from information. Hence, a logic system could naturally be incorporated for the reasoning in a recommendation task. However, although hard-rule approaches based on logic systems can provide powerful reasoning ability, they struggle to cope with inconsistent and incomplete knowledge in real-world tasks, especially for complex tasks such as recommendation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic recommendation model, which transforms the user history interactions into a logic expression and then transforms the recommendation prediction into a query task based on this logic expression. The logic expressions are then computed based on the modular logic operations of the neural network. We also construct an implicit logic encoder to reasonably reduce the complexity of the logic computation. Finally, a user's interest items can be queried in the vector space based on the computation results. Experiments on three well-known datasets verified that our method performs better compared to state of the art shallow, deep, session, and reasoning models.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07597">C-Pack: Packaged Resources To Advance General Chinese Embedding</a><br>
                Authors: Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Niklas Muennighof <br>
                Abstract: We introduce C-Pack, a package of resources that significantly advance the field of general Chinese embeddings. C-Pack includes three critical resources. 1) C-MTEB is a comprehensive benchmark for Chinese text embeddings covering 6 tasks and 35 datasets. 2) C-MTP is a massive text embedding dataset curated from labeled and unlabeled Chinese corpora for training embedding models. 3) C-TEM is a family of embedding models covering multiple sizes. Our models outperform all prior Chinese text embeddings on C-MTEB by up to +10% upon the time of the release. We also integrate and optimize the entire suite of training methods for C-TEM. Along with our resources on general Chinese embedding, we release our data and models for English text embeddings. The English models achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB benchmark; meanwhile, our released English data is 2 times larger than the Chinese data. All these resources are made publicly available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07601">Detecting Misinformation with LLM-Predicted Credibility Signals and Weak  Supervision</a><br>
                Authors: João A. Leite, Olesya Razuvayevskaya, Kalina Bontcheva, Carolina Scarton <br>
                Abstract: Credibility signals represent a wide range of heuristics that are typically used by journalists and fact-checkers to assess the veracity of online content. Automating the task of credibility signal extraction, however, is very challenging as it requires high-accuracy signal-specific extractors to be trained, while there are currently no sufficiently large datasets annotated with all credibility signals. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can be prompted effectively with a set of 18 credibility signals to produce weak labels for each signal. We then aggregate these potentially noisy labels using weak supervision in order to predict content veracity. We demonstrate that our approach, which combines zero-shot LLM credibility signal labeling and weak supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on two misinformation datasets without using any ground-truth labels for training. We also analyse the contribution of the individual credibility signals towards predicting content veracity, which provides new valuable insights into their role in misinformation detection.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07606">Zero-shot Audio Topic Reranking using Large Language Models</a><br>
                Authors: Mengjie Qian, Rao Ma, Adian Liusie, Erfan Loweimi, Kate M. Knill, Mark J.F. Gales <br>
                Abstract: The Multimodal Video Search by Examples (MVSE) project investigates using video clips as the query term for information retrieval, rather than the more traditional text query. This enables far richer search modalities such as images, speaker, content, topic, and emotion. A key element for this process is highly rapid, flexible, search to support large archives, which in MVSE is facilitated by representing video attributes by embeddings. This work aims to mitigate any performance loss from this rapid archive search by examining reranking approaches. In particular, zero-shot reranking methods using large language models are investigated as these are applicable to any video archive audio content. Performance is evaluated for topic-based retrieval on a publicly available video archive, the BBC Rewind corpus. Results demonstrate that reranking can achieve improved retrieval ranking without the need for any task-specific training data.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07610">Feature Engineering in Learning-to-Rank for Community Question Answering  Task</a><br>
                Authors: Nafis Sajid, Md Rashidul Hasan, Muhammad Ibrahim <br>
                Abstract: Community question answering (CQA) forums are Internet-based platforms where users ask questions about a topic and other expert users try to provide solutions. Many CQA forums such as Quora, Stackoverflow, Yahoo!Answer, StackExchange exist with a lot of user-generated data. These data are leveraged in automated CQA ranking systems where similar questions (and answers) are presented in response to the query of the user. In this work, we empirically investigate a few aspects of this domain. Firstly, in addition to traditional features like TF-IDF, BM25 etc., we introduce a BERT-based feature that captures the semantic similarity between the question and answer. Secondly, most of the existing research works have focused on features extracted only from the question part; features extracted from answers have not been explored extensively. We combine both types of features in a linear fashion. Thirdly, using our proposed concepts, we conduct an empirical investigation with different rank-learning algorithms, some of which have not been used so far in CQA domain. On three standard CQA datasets, our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also analyze importance of the features we use in our investigation. This work is expected to guide the practitioners to select a better set of features for the CQA retrieval task.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07616">Road Disease Detection based on Latent Domain Background Feature  Separation and Suppression</a><br>
                Authors: Juwu Zheng, Jiangtao Ren <br>
                Abstract: Road disease detection is challenging due to the the small proportion of road damage in target region and the diverse background,which introduce lots of domain information.Besides, disease categories have high similarity,makes the detection more difficult. In this paper, we propose a new LDBFSS(Latent Domain Background Feature Separation and Suppression) network which could perform background information separation and suppression without domain supervision and contrastive enhancement of object features.We combine our LDBFSS network with YOLOv5 model to enhance disease features for better road disease detection. As the components of LDBFSS network, we first design a latent domain discovery module and a domain adversarial learning module to obtain pseudo domain labels through unsupervised method, guiding domain discriminator and model to train adversarially to suppress background information. In addition, we introduce a contrastive learning module and design k-instance contrastive loss, optimize the disease feature representation by increasing the inter-class distance and reducing the intra-class distance for object features. We conducted experiments on two road disease detection datasets, GRDDC and CNRDD, and compared with other models,which show an increase of nearly 4% on GRDDC dataset compared with optimal model, and an increase of 4.6% on CNRDD dataset. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and superiority of our model.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07623">SwitchGPT: Adapting Large Language Models for Non-Text Outputs</a><br>
                Authors: Xinyu Wang, Bohan Zhuang, Qi Wu <br>
                Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily trained on text-based datasets, exhibit exceptional proficiencies in understanding and executing complex linguistic instructions via text outputs. However, they falter when requests to generate non-text ones. Concurrently, modality conversion models, such as text-to-image, despite generating high-quality images, suffer from a lack of extensive textual pretraining. As a result, these models are only capable of accommodating specific image descriptions rather than comprehending more complex instructions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach, \methodname, from a modality conversion perspective that evolves a text-based LLM into a multi-modal one. We specifically employ a minimal dataset to instruct LLMs to recognize the intended output modality as directed by the instructions. Consequently, the adapted LLM can effectively summon various off-the-shelf modality conversion models from the model zoos to generate non-text responses. This circumvents the necessity for complicated pretraining that typically requires immense quantities of paired multi-modal data, while simultaneously inheriting the extensive knowledge of LLMs and the ability of high-quality generative models. To evaluate and compare the adapted multi-modal LLM with its traditional counterparts, we have constructed a multi-modal instruction benchmark that solicits diverse modality outputs. The experiment results reveal that, with minimal training, LLMs can be conveniently adapted to comprehend requests for non-text responses, thus achieving higher flexibility in multi-modal scenarios.

                Authors: Xiyan Fu, Anette Frank <br>
                Abstract: Despite the success of neural models in solving reasoning tasks, their compositional generalization capabilities remain unclear. In this work, we propose a new setting of the structured explanation generation task to facilitate compositional reasoning research. Previous works found that symbolic methods achieve superior compositionality by using pre-defined inference rules for iterative reasoning. But these approaches rely on brittle symbolic transfers and are restricted to well-defined tasks. Hence, we propose a dynamic modularized reasoning model, MORSE, to improve the compositional generalization of neural models. MORSE factorizes the inference process into a combination of modules, where each module represents a functional unit. Specifically, we adopt modularized self-attention to dynamically select and route inputs to dedicated heads, which specializes them to specific functions. We conduct experiments for increasing lengths and shapes of reasoning trees on two benchmarks to test MORSE's compositional generalization abilities, and find it outperforms competitive baselines. Model ablation and deeper analyses show the effectiveness of dynamic reasoning modules and their generalization abilities.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07640">Indoor Scene Reconstruction with Fine-Grained Details Using Hybrid  Representation and Normal Prior Enhancement</a><br>
                Authors: Sheng Ye, Yubin Hu, Matthieu Lin, Yu-Hui Wen, Wang Zhao, Wenping Wang, Yong-Jin Liu <br>
                Abstract: The reconstruction of indoor scenes from multi-view RGB images is challenging due to the coexistence of flat and texture-less regions alongside delicate and fine-grained regions. Recent methods leverage neural radiance fields aided by predicted surface normal priors to recover the scene geometry. These methods excel in producing complete and smooth results for floor and wall areas. However, they struggle to capture complex surfaces with high-frequency structures due to the inadequate neural representation and the inaccurately predicted normal priors. To improve the capacity of the implicit representation, we propose a hybrid architecture to represent low-frequency and high-frequency regions separately. To enhance the normal priors, we introduce a simple yet effective image sharpening and denoising technique, coupled with a network that estimates the pixel-wise uncertainty of the predicted surface normal vectors. Identifying such uncertainty can prevent our model from being misled by unreliable surface normal supervisions that hinder the accurate reconstruction of intricate geometries. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of reconstruction quality.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07650">Automatic Data Visualization Generation from Chinese Natural Language  Questions</a><br>
                Authors: Yan Ge, Victor Junqiu Wei, Yuanfeng Song, Jason Chen Zhang, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong <br>
                Abstract: Data visualization has emerged as an effective tool for getting insights from massive datasets. Due to the hardness of manipulating the programming languages of data visualization, automatic data visualization generation from natural languages (Text-to-Vis) is becoming increasingly popular. Despite the plethora of research effort on the English Text-to-Vis, studies have yet to be conducted on data visualization generation from questions in Chinese. Motivated by this, we propose a Chinese Text-to-Vis dataset in the paper and demonstrate our first attempt to tackle this problem. Our model integrates multilingual BERT as the encoder, boosts the cross-lingual ability, and infuses the $n$-gram information into our word representation learning. Our experimental results show that our dataset is challenging and deserves further research.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07654">Towards Robust and Unconstrained Full Range of Rotation Head Pose  Estimation</a><br>
                Authors: Thorsten Hempel, Ahmed A. Abdelrahman, Ayoub Al-Hamadi <br>
                Abstract: Estimating the head pose of a person is a crucial problem for numerous applications that is yet mainly addressed as a subtask of frontal pose prediction. We present a novel method for unconstrained end-to-end head pose estimation to tackle the challenging task of full range of orientation head pose prediction. We address the issue of ambiguous rotation labels by introducing the rotation matrix formalism for our ground truth data and propose a continuous 6D rotation matrix representation for efficient and robust direct regression. This allows to efficiently learn full rotation appearance and to overcome the limitations of the current state-of-the-art. Together with new accumulated training data that provides full head pose rotation data and a geodesic loss approach for stable learning, we design an advanced model that is able to predict an extended range of head orientations. An extensive evaluation on public datasets demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in an efficient and robust manner, while its advanced prediction range allows the expansion of the application area. We open-source our training and testing code along with our trained models: https://github.com/thohemp/6DRepNet360.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07666">Multi-Source Domain Adaptation meets Dataset Distillation through  Dataset Dictionary Learning</a><br>
                Authors: Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma, Fred Ngolè Mboula, Antoine Souloumiac <br>
                Abstract: In this paper, we consider the intersection of two problems in machine learning: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) and Dataset Distillation (DD). On the one hand, the first considers adapting multiple heterogeneous labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. On the other hand, the second attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD. To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD method Distribution Matching. We thoroughly experiment with this novel problem on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor, and Case Western Reserve University), where we show that, even with as little as 1 sample per class, one achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07668">CoRF : Colorizing Radiance Fields using Knowledge Distillation</a><br>
                Authors: Ankit Dhiman, R Srinath, Srinjay Sarkar, Lokesh R Boregowda, R Venkatesh Babu <br>
                Abstract: Neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods enable high-quality novel-view synthesis for multi-view images. This work presents a method for synthesizing colorized novel views from input grey-scale multi-view images. When we apply image or video-based colorization methods on the generated grey-scale novel views, we observe artifacts due to inconsistency across views. Training a radiance field network on the colorized grey-scale image sequence also does not solve the 3D consistency issue. We propose a distillation based method to transfer color knowledge from the colorization networks trained on natural images to the radiance field network. Specifically, our method uses the radiance field network as a 3D representation and transfers knowledge from existing 2D colorization methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces superior colorized novel views for indoor and outdoor scenes while maintaining cross-view consistency than baselines. Further, we show the efficacy of our method on applications like colorization of radiance field network trained from 1.) Infra-Red (IR) multi-view images and 2.) Old grey-scale multi-view image sequences.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07670">Federated Dataset Dictionary Learning for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation</a><br>
                Authors: Fabiola Espinosa Castellon, Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma, Fred Ngolè Mboula, Aurélien Mayoue, Antoine Souloumiac, Cédric Gouy-Pallier <br>
                Abstract: In this article, we propose an approach for federated domain adaptation, a setting where distributional shift exists among clients and some have unlabeled data. The proposed framework, FedDaDiL, tackles the resulting challenge through dictionary learning of empirical distributions. In our setting, clients' distributions represent particular domains, and FedDaDiL collectively trains a federated dictionary of empirical distributions. In particular, we build upon the Dataset Dictionary Learning framework by designing collaborative communication protocols and aggregation operations. The chosen protocols keep clients' data private, thus enhancing overall privacy compared to its centralized counterpart. We empirically demonstrate that our approach successfully generates labeled data on the target domain with extensive experiments on (i) Caltech-Office, (ii) TEP, and (iii) CWRU benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart and other benchmarks in federated domain adaptation.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07672">Physics-constrained robust learning of open-form PDEs from limited and  noisy data</a><br>
                Authors: Mengge Du, Longfeng Nie, Siyu Lou, Yuntian Chenc, Dongxiao Zhang <br>
                Abstract: Unveiling the underlying governing equations of nonlinear dynamic systems remains a significant challenge, especially when encountering noisy observations and no prior knowledge available. This study proposes R-DISCOVER, a framework designed to robustly uncover open-form partial differential equations (PDEs) from limited and noisy data. The framework operates through two alternating update processes: discovering and embedding. The discovering phase employs symbolic representation and a reinforcement learning (RL)-guided hybrid PDE generator to efficiently produce diverse open-form PDEs with tree structures. A neural network-based predictive model fits the system response and serves as the reward evaluator for the generated PDEs. PDEs with superior fits are utilized to iteratively optimize the generator via the RL method and the best-performing PDE is selected by a parameter-free stability metric. The embedding phase integrates the initially identified PDE from the discovering process as a physical constraint into the predictive model for robust training. The traversal of PDE trees automates the construction of the computational graph and the embedding process without human intervention. Numerical experiments demonstrate our framework's capability to uncover governing equations from nonlinear dynamic systems with limited and highly noisy data and outperform other physics-informed neural network-based discovery methods. This work opens new potential for exploring real-world systems with limited understanding.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07675">Goal Space Abstraction in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via  Set-Based Reachability Analysis</a><br>
                Authors: Mehdi Zadem, Sergio Mover, Sao Mai Nguyen <br>
                Abstract: Open-ended learning benefits immensely from the use of symbolic methods for goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical information, such as the environment dynamics. In this paper, we propose a developmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar roles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns both the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses symbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the transition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation. We evaluate our approach on complex navigation tasks, showing the learned representation is interpretable, transferrable and results in data efficient learning.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07677">Aligning Speakers: Evaluating and Visualizing Text-based Diarization  Using Efficient Multiple Sequence Alignment (Extended Version)</a><br>
                Authors: Chen Gong, Peilin Wu, Jinho D. Choi <br>
                Abstract: This paper presents a novel evaluation approach to text-based speaker diarization (SD), tackling the limitations of traditional metrics that do not account for any contextual information in text. Two new metrics are proposed, Text-based Diarization Error Rate and Diarization F1, which perform utterance- and word-level evaluations by aligning tokens in reference and hypothesis transcripts. Our metrics encompass more types of errors compared to existing ones, allowing us to make a more comprehensive analysis in SD. To align tokens, a multiple sequence alignment algorithm is introduced that supports multiple sequences in the reference while handling high-dimensional alignment to the hypothesis using dynamic programming. Our work is packaged into two tools, align4d providing an API for our alignment algorithm and TranscribeView for visualizing and evaluating SD errors, which can greatly aid in the creation of high-quality data, fostering the advancement of dialogue systems.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07682">A Conversation is Worth A Thousand Recommendations: A Survey of Holistic  Conversational Recommender Systems</a><br>
                Authors: Chuang Li, Hengchang Hu, Yan Zhang, Min-Yen Kan, Haizhou Li <br>
                Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) generate recommendations through an interactive process. However, not all CRS approaches use human conversations as their source of interaction data; the majority of prior CRS work simulates interactions by exchanging entity-level information. As a result, claims of prior CRS work do not generalise to real-world settings where conversations take unexpected turns, or where conversational and intent understanding is not perfect. To tackle this challenge, the research community has started to examine holistic CRS, which are trained using conversational data collected from real-world scenarios. Despite their emergence, such holistic approaches are under-explored. We present a comprehensive survey of holistic CRS methods by summarizing the literature in a structured manner. Our survey recognises holistic CRS approaches as having three components: 1) a backbone language model, the optional use of 2) external knowledge, and/or 3) external guidance. We also give a detailed analysis of CRS datasets and evaluation methods in real application scenarios. We offer our insight as to the current challenges of holistic CRS and possible future trends.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07683">Assessing the nature of large language models: A caution against  anthropocentrism</a><br>
                Authors: Ann Speed <br>
                Abstract: Generative AI models garnered a large amount of public attention and speculation with the release of OpenAIs chatbot, ChatGPT. At least two opinion camps exist: one excited about possibilities these models offer for fundamental changes to human tasks, and another highly concerned about power these models seem to have. To address these concerns, we assessed GPT3.5 using standard, normed, and validated cognitive and personality measures. For this seedling project, we developed a battery of tests that allowed us to estimate the boundaries of some of these models capabilities, how stable those capabilities are over a short period of time, and how they compare to humans. Our results indicate that GPT 3.5 is unlikely to have developed sentience, although its ability to respond to personality inventories is interesting. It did display large variability in both cognitive and personality measures over repeated observations, which is not expected if it had a human-like personality. Variability notwithstanding, GPT3.5 displays what in a human would be considered poor mental health, including low self-esteem and marked dissociation from reality despite upbeat and helpful responses.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07684">deepFDEnet: A Novel Neural Network Architecture for Solving Fractional  Differential Equations</a><br>
                Authors: Ali Nosrati Firoozsalari, Hassan Dana Mazraeh, Alireza Afzal Aghaei, Kourosh Parand <br>
                Abstract: The primary goal of this research is to propose a novel architecture for a deep neural network that can solve fractional differential equations accurately. A Gaussian integration rule and a $L_1$ discretization technique are used in the proposed design. In each equation, a deep neural network is used to approximate the unknown function. Three forms of fractional differential equations have been examined to highlight the method's versatility: a fractional ordinary differential equation, a fractional order integrodifferential equation, and a fractional order partial differential equation. The results show that the proposed architecture solves different forms of fractional differential equations with excellent precision.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07689">Detecting ChatGPT: A Survey of the State of Detecting ChatGPT-Generated  Text</a><br>
                Authors: Mahdi Dhaini, Wessel Poelman, Ege Erdogan <br>
                Abstract: While recent advancements in the capabilities and widespread accessibility of generative language models, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), have brought about various benefits by generating fluent human-like text, the task of distinguishing between human- and large language model (LLM) generated text has emerged as a crucial problem. These models can potentially deceive by generating artificial text that appears to be human-generated. This issue is particularly significant in domains such as law, education, and science, where ensuring the integrity of text is of the utmost importance. This survey provides an overview of the current approaches employed to differentiate between texts generated by humans and ChatGPT. We present an account of the different datasets constructed for detecting ChatGPT-generated text, the various methods utilized, what qualitative analyses into the characteristics of human versus ChatGPT-generated text have been performed, and finally, summarize our findings into general insights<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07694">Tree of Uncertain Thoughts Reasoning for Large Language Models</a><br>
                Authors: Shentong Mo, Miao Xin <br>
                Abstract: While the recently introduced Tree of Thoughts (ToT) has heralded advancements in allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason through foresight and backtracking for global decision-making, it has overlooked the inherent local uncertainties in intermediate decision points or "thoughts". These local uncertainties, intrinsic to LLMs given their potential for diverse responses, remain a significant concern in the reasoning process. Addressing this pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a reasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs' diverse local responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty quantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model's precision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous experiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords. The empirical evidence underscores TouT's superiority over both ToT and chain-of-thought prompting methods.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07698">Dataset Condensation via Generative Model</a><br>
                Authors: David Junhao Zhang, Heng Wang, Chuhui Xue, Rui Yan, Wenqing Zhang, Song Bai, Mike Zheng Shou <br>
                Abstract: Dataset condensation aims to condense a large dataset with a lot of training samples into a small set. Previous methods usually condense the dataset into the pixels format. However, it suffers from slow optimization speed and large number of parameters to be optimized. When increasing image resolutions and classes, the number of learnable parameters grows accordingly, prohibiting condensation methods from scaling up to large datasets with diverse classes. Moreover, the relations among condensed samples have been neglected and hence the feature distribution of condensed samples is often not diverse. To solve these problems, we propose to condense the dataset into another format, a generative model. Such a novel format allows for the condensation of large datasets because the size of the generative model remains relatively stable as the number of classes or image resolution increases. Furthermore, an intra-class and an inter-class loss are proposed to model the relation of condensed samples. Intra-class loss aims to create more diverse samples for each class by pushing each sample away from the others of the same class. Meanwhile, inter-class loss increases the discriminability of samples by widening the gap between the centers of different classes. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our method and its individual component. To our best knowledge, we are the first to successfully conduct condensation on ImageNet-1k.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07703">Causal Entropy and Information Gain for Measuring Causal Control</a><br>
                Authors: Francisco Nunes Ferreira Quialheiro Simoes, Mehdi Dastani, Thijs van Ommen <br>
                Abstract: Artificial intelligence models and methods commonly lack causal interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning (IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training, would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system, which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated, highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our investigation paves the way for the development of methods with improved interpretability in domains involving causation.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07704">NutritionVerse: Empirical Study of Various Dietary Intake Estimation  Approaches</a><br>
                Authors: Chi-en Amy Tai, Matthew Keller, Saeejith Nair, Yuhao Chen, Yifan Wu, Olivia Markham, Krish Parmar, Pengcheng Xi, Heather Keller, Sharon Kirkpatrick, Alexander Wong <br>
                Abstract: Accurate dietary intake estimation is critical for informing policies and programs to support healthy eating, as malnutrition has been directly linked to decreased quality of life. However self-reporting methods such as food diaries suffer from substantial bias. Other conventional dietary assessment techniques and emerging alternative approaches such as mobile applications incur high time costs and may necessitate trained personnel. Recent work has focused on using computer vision and machine learning to automatically estimate dietary intake from food images, but the lack of comprehensive datasets with diverse viewpoints, modalities and food annotations hinders the accuracy and realism of such methods. To address this limitation, we introduce NutritionVerse-Synth, the first large-scale dataset of 84,984 photorealistic synthetic 2D food images with associated dietary information and multimodal annotations (including depth images, instance masks, and semantic masks). Additionally, we collect a real image dataset, NutritionVerse-Real, containing 889 images of 251 dishes to evaluate realism. Leveraging these novel datasets, we develop and benchmark NutritionVerse, an empirical study of various dietary intake estimation approaches, including indirect segmentation-based and direct prediction networks. We further fine-tune models pretrained on synthetic data with real images to provide insights into the fusion of synthetic and real data. Finally, we release both datasets (NutritionVerse-Synth, NutritionVerse-Real) on https://www.kaggle.com/nutritionverse/datasets as part of an open initiative to accelerate machine learning for dietary sensing.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07707">CoLLD: Contrastive Layer-to-layer Distillation for Compressing  Multilingual Pre-trained Speech Encoders</a><br>
                Authors: Heng-Jui Chang, Ning Dong, Ruslan Mavlyutov, Sravya Popuri, Yu-An Chung <br>
                Abstract: Large-scale self-supervised pre-trained speech encoders outperform conventional approaches in speech recognition and translation tasks. Due to the high cost of developing these large models, building new encoders for new tasks and deploying them to on-device applications are infeasible. Prior studies propose model compression methods to address this issue, but those works focus on smaller models and less realistic tasks. Thus, we propose Contrastive Layer-to-layer Distillation (CoLLD), a novel knowledge distillation method to compress pre-trained speech encoders by leveraging masked prediction and contrastive learning to train student models to copy the behavior of a large teacher model. CoLLD outperforms prior methods and closes the gap between small and large models on multilingual speech-to-text translation and recognition benchmarks.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07708">Market-GAN: Adding Control to Financial Market Data Generation with  Semantic Context</a><br>
                Authors: Haochong Xia, Shuo Sun, Xinrun Wang, Bo An <br>
                Abstract: Financial simulators play an important role in enhancing forecasting accuracy, managing risks, and fostering strategic financial decision-making. Despite the development of financial market simulation methodologies, existing frameworks often struggle with adapting to specialized simulation context. We pinpoint the challenges as i) current financial datasets do not contain context labels; ii) current techniques are not designed to generate financial data with context as control, which demands greater precision compared to other modalities; iii) the inherent difficulties in generating context-aligned, high-fidelity data given the non-stationary, noisy nature of financial data. To address these challenges, our contributions are: i) we proposed the Contextual Market Dataset with market dynamics, stock ticker, and history state as context, leveraging a market dynamics modeling method that combines linear regression and Dynamic Time Warping clustering to extract market dynamics; ii) we present Market-GAN, a novel architecture incorporating a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for the controllable generation with context, an autoencoder for learning low-dimension features, and supervisors for knowledge transfer; iii) we introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure that Market-GAN captures the intrinsic market distribution with multiple objectives. In the pertaining stage, with the use of the autoencoder and supervisors, we prepare the generator with a better initialization for the adversarial training stage. We propose a set of holistic evaluation metrics that consider alignment, fidelity, data usability on downstream tasks, and market facts. We evaluate Market-GAN with the Dow Jones Industrial Average data from 2000 to 2023 and showcase superior performance in comparison to 4 state-of-the-art time-series generative models.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07716">Understanding Vector-Valued Neural Networks and Their Relationship with  Real and Hypercomplex-Valued Neural Networks</a><br>
                Authors: Marcos Eduardo Valle <br>
                Abstract: Despite the many successful applications of deep learning models for multidimensional signal and image processing, most traditional neural networks process data represented by (multidimensional) arrays of real numbers. The intercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned from the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In contrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of vectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels. Consequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust training than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad framework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this context, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued models with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains the relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks. Precisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing restrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between feature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued neural networks, can be implemented in current deep-learning libraries as real-valued networks.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07719">L1-aware Multilingual Mispronunciation Detection Framework</a><br>
                Authors: Yassine El Kheir, Shammur Absar Chwodhury, Ahmed Ali <br>
                Abstract: The phonological discrepancies between a speaker's native (L1) and the non-native language (L2) serves as a major factor for mispronunciation. This paper introduces a novel multilingual MDD architecture, L1-MultiMDD, enriched with L1-aware speech representation. An end-to-end speech encoder is trained on the input signal and its corresponding reference phoneme sequence. First, an attention mechanism is deployed to align the input audio with the reference phoneme sequence. Afterwards, the L1-L2-speech embedding are extracted from an auxiliary model, pretrained in a multi-task setup identifying L1 and L2 language, and are infused with the primary network. Finally, the L1-MultiMDD is then optimized for a unified multilingual phoneme recognition task using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss for the target languages: English, Arabic, and Mandarin. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed L1-MultiMDD framework on both seen -- L2-ARTIC, LATIC, and AraVoiceL2v2; and unseen -- EpaDB and Speechocean762 datasets. The consistent gains in PER, and false rejection rate (FRR) across all target languages confirm our approach's robustness, efficacy, and generalizability.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07727">PerPLM: Personalized Fine-tuning of Pretrained Language Models via  Writer-specific Intermediate Learning and Prompts</a><br>
                Authors: Daisuke Oba, Naoki Yoshinaga, Masashi Toyoda <br>
                Abstract: The meanings of words and phrases depend not only on where they are used (contexts) but also on who use them (writers). Pretrained language models (PLMs) are powerful tools for capturing context, but they are typically pretrained and fine-tuned for universal use across different writers. This study aims to improve the accuracy of text understanding tasks by personalizing the fine-tuning of PLMs for specific writers. We focus on a general setting where only the plain text from target writers are available for personalization. To avoid the cost of fine-tuning and storing multiple copies of PLMs for different users, we exhaustively explore using writer-specific prompts to personalize a unified PLM. Since the design and evaluation of these prompts is an underdeveloped area, we introduce and compare different types of prompts that are possible in our setting. To maximize the potential of prompt-based personalized fine-tuning, we propose a personalized intermediate learning based on masked language modeling to extract task-independent traits of writers' text. Our experiments, using multiple tasks, datasets, and PLMs, reveal the nature of different prompts and the effectiveness of our intermediate learning approach.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07733">Explaining Speech Classification Models via Word-Level Audio Segments  and Paralinguistic Features</a><br>
                Authors: Eliana Pastor, Alkis Koudounas, Giuseppe Attanasio, Dirk Hovy, Elena Baralis <br>
                Abstract: Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) have provided new insights into how models for vision, language, and tabular data operate. However, few approaches exist for understanding speech models. Existing work focuses on a few spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks, and explanations are difficult to interpret for most users. We introduce a new approach to explain speech classification models. We generate easy-to-interpret explanations via input perturbation on two information levels. 1) Word-level explanations reveal how each word-related audio segment impacts the outcome. 2) Paralinguistic features (e.g., prosody and background noise) answer the counterfactual: ``What would the model prediction be if we edited the audio signal in this way?'' We validate our approach by explaining two state-of-the-art SLU models on two speech classification tasks in English and Italian. Our findings demonstrate that the explanations are faithful to the model's inner workings and plausible to humans. Our method and findings pave the way for future research on interpreting speech models.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07739">The complementary roles of non-verbal cues for Robust Pronunciation  Assessment</a><br>

                Abstract: Research on pronunciation assessment systems focuses on utilizing phonetic and phonological aspects of non-native (L2) speech, often neglecting the rich layer of information hidden within the non-verbal cues. In this study, we proposed a novel pronunciation assessment framework, IntraVerbalPA. % The framework innovatively incorporates both fine-grained frame- and abstract utterance-level non-verbal cues, alongside the conventional speech and phoneme representations. Additionally, we introduce ''Goodness of phonemic-duration'' metric to effectively model duration distribution within the framework. Our results validate the effectiveness of the proposed IntraVerbalPA framework and its individual components, yielding performance that either matches or outperforms existing research works.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07742">Interpretability is in the Mind of the Beholder: A Causal Framework for  Human-interpretable Representation Learning</a><br>
                Authors: Emanuele Marconato, Andrea Passerini, Stefano Teso <br>
                Abstract: Focus in Explainable AI is shifting from explanations defined in terms of low-level elements, such as input features, to explanations encoded in terms of interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in Human-interpretable Representation Learning (HRL) is how to model and operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of HRL builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us to derive a principled notion of alignment between the machine representation and the vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of representations, namely disentanglment. We also show that alignment is linked to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on human-interpretable representations.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07749">OmnimatteRF: Robust Omnimatte with 3D Background Modeling</a><br>
                Authors: Geng Lin, Chen Gao, Jia-Bin Huang, Changil Kim, Yipeng Wang, Matthias Zwicker, Ayush Saraf <br>
                Abstract: Video matting has broad applications, from adding interesting effects to casually captured movies to assisting video production professionals. Matting with associated effects such as shadows and reflections has also attracted increasing research activity, and methods like Omnimatte have been proposed to separate dynamic foreground objects of interest into their own layers. However, prior works represent video backgrounds as 2D image layers, limiting their capacity to express more complicated scenes, thus hindering application to real-world videos. In this paper, we propose a novel video matting method, OmnimatteRF, that combines dynamic 2D foreground layers and a 3D background model. The 2D layers preserve the details of the subjects, while the 3D background robustly reconstructs scenes in real-world videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method reconstructs scenes with better quality on various videos.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07752">DT-NeRF: Decomposed Triplane-Hash Neural Radiance Fields for  High-Fidelity Talking Portrait Synthesis</a><br>

                Abstract: In this paper, we present the decomposed triplane-hash neural radiance fields (DT-NeRF), a framework that significantly improves the photorealistic rendering of talking faces and achieves state-of-the-art results on key evaluation datasets. Our architecture decomposes the facial region into two specialized triplanes: one specialized for representing the mouth, and the other for the broader facial features. We introduce audio features as residual terms and integrate them as query vectors into our model through an audio-mouth-face transformer. Additionally, our method leverages the capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to enrich the volumetric representation of the entire face through additive volumetric rendering techniques. Comprehensive experimental evaluations corroborate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07753">Co-Salient Object Detection with Semantic-Level Consensus Extraction and  Dispersion</a><br>
                Authors: Peiran Xu, Yadong Mu <br>
                Abstract: Given a group of images, co-salient object detection (CoSOD) aims to highlight the common salient object in each image. There are two factors closely related to the success of this task, namely consensus extraction, and the dispersion of consensus to each image. Most previous works represent the group consensus using local features, while we instead utilize a hierarchical Transformer module for extracting semantic-level consensus. Therefore, it can obtain a more comprehensive representation of the common object category, and exclude interference from other objects that share local similarities with the target object. In addition, we propose a Transformer-based dispersion module that takes into account the variation of the co-salient object in different scenes. It distributes the consensus to the image feature maps in an image-specific way while making full use of interactions within the group. These two modules are integrated with a ViT encoder and an FPN-like decoder to form an end-to-end trainable network, without additional branch and auxiliary loss. The proposed method is evaluated on three commonly used CoSOD datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07755">Generative AI Text Classification using Ensemble LLM Approaches</a><br>
                Authors: Harika Abburi, Michael Suesserman, Nirmala Pudota, Balaji Veeramani, Edward Bowen, Sanmitra Bhattacharya <br>
                Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and natural language processing tasks, such as content creation, report generation, etc. However, unregulated malign application of these models can create undesirable consequences such as generation of fake news, plagiarism, etc. As a result, accurate detection of AI-generated language can be crucial in responsible usage of LLMs. In this work, we explore 1) whether a certain body of text is AI generated or written by human, and 2) attribution of a specific language model in generating a body of text. Texts in both English and Spanish are considered. The datasets used in this study are provided as part of the Automated Text Identification (AuTexTification) shared task. For each of the research objectives stated above, we propose an ensemble neural model that generates probabilities from different pre-trained LLMs which are used as features to a Traditional Machine Learning (TML) classifier following it. For the first task of distinguishing between AI and human generated text, our model ranked in fifth and thirteenth place (with macro $F1$ scores of 0.733 and 0.649) for English and Spanish texts, respectively. For the second task on model attribution, our model ranked in first place with macro $F1$ scores of 0.625 and 0.653 for English and Spanish texts, respectively.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07759">PROGrasp: Pragmatic Human-Robot Communication for Object Grasping</a><br>
                Authors: Gi-Cheon Kang, Junghyun Kim, Jaein Kim, Byoung-Tak Zhang <br>
                Abstract: Interactive Object Grasping (IOG) is the task of identifying and grasping the desired object via human-robot natural language interaction. Current IOG systems assume that a human user initially specifies the target object's category (e.g., bottle). Inspired by pragmatics, where humans often convey their intentions by relying on context to achieve goals, we introduce a new IOG task, Pragmatic-IOG, and the corresponding dataset, Intention-oriented Multi-modal Dialogue (IM-Dial). In our proposed task scenario, an intention-oriented utterance (e.g., "I am thirsty") is initially given to the robot. The robot should then identify the target object by interacting with a human user. Based on the task setup, we propose a new robotic system that can interpret the user's intention and pick up the target object, Pragmatic Object Grasping (PROGrasp). PROGrasp performs Pragmatic-IOG by incorporating modules for visual grounding, question asking, object grasping, and most importantly, answer interpretation for pragmatic inference. Experimental results show that PROGrasp is effective in offline (i.e., target object discovery) and online (i.e., IOG with a physical robot arm) settings.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07760">PRE: Vision-Language Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder</a><br>
                Authors: Anh Pham Thi Minh <br>
                Abstract: Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated great potential in zero-shot transferability to downstream tasks. However, to attain optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes. Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of 5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07794">Improving Multimodal Classification of Social Media Posts by Leveraging  Image-Text Auxiliary tasks</a><br>
                Authors: Danae Sánchez Villegas, Daniel Preoţiuc-Pietro, Nikolaos Aletras <br>
                Abstract: Effectively leveraging multimodal information from social media posts is essential to various downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm detection and hate speech classification. However, combining text and image information is challenging because of the idiosyncratic cross-modal semantics with hidden or complementary information present in matching image-text pairs. In this work, we aim to directly model this by proposing the use of two auxiliary losses jointly with the main task when fine-tuning any pre-trained multimodal model. Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) brings image-text representations of a post closer together and separates them from different posts, capturing underlying dependencies. Image-Text Matching (ITM) facilitates the understanding of semantic correspondence between images and text by penalizing unrelated pairs. We combine these objectives with five multimodal models, demonstrating consistent improvements across four popular social media datasets. Furthermore, through detailed analysis, we shed light on the specific scenarios and cases where each auxiliary task proves to be most effective.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07796">For A More Comprehensive Evaluation of 6DoF Object Pose Tracking</a><br>
                Authors: Yang Li, Fan Zhong, Xin Wang, Shuangbing Song, Jiachen Li, Xueying Qin, Changhe Tu <br>
                Abstract: Previous evaluations on 6DoF object pose tracking have presented obvious limitations along with the development of this area. In particular, the evaluation protocols are not unified for different methods, the widely-used YCBV dataset contains significant annotation error, and the error metrics also may be biased. As a result, it is hard to fairly compare the methods, which has became a big obstacle for developing new algorithms. In this paper we contribute a unified benchmark to address the above problems. For more accurate annotation of YCBV, we propose a multi-view multi-object global pose refinement method, which can jointly refine the poses of all objects and view cameras, resulting in sub-pixel sub-millimeter alignment errors. The limitations of previous scoring methods and error metrics are analyzed, based on which we introduce our improved evaluation methods. The unified benchmark takes both YCBV and BCOT as base datasets, which are shown to be complementary in scene categories. In experiments, we validate the precision and reliability of the proposed global pose refinement method with a realistic semi-synthesized dataset particularly for YCBV, and then present the benchmark results unifying learning&non-learning and RGB&RGBD methods, with some finds not discovered in previous studies.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07797">The Dynamical Principles of Storytelling</a><br>

                Abstract: When considering the opening part of 1800 short stories, we find that the first dozen paragraphs of the average narrative follow an action principle as defined in arXiv:2309.06600. When the order of the paragraphs is shuffled, the average no longer exhibits this property. The findings show that there is a preferential direction we take in semantic space when starting a story, possibly related to a common Western storytelling tradition as implied by Aristotle in Poetics.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07808">What Matters to Enhance Traffic Rule Compliance of Imitation Learning  for Automated Driving</a><br>
                Authors: Hongkuan Zhou, Aifen Sui, Wei Cao, Letian Shi <br>
                Abstract: More research attention has recently been given to end-to-end autonomous driving technologies where the entire driving pipeline is replaced with a single neural network because of its simpler structure and faster inference time. Despite this appealing approach largely reducing the components in driving pipeline, its simplicity also leads to interpretability problems and safety issues arXiv:2003.06404. The trained policy is not always compliant with the traffic rules and it is also hard to discover the reason for the misbehavior because of the lack of intermediate outputs. Meanwhile, Sensors are also critical to autonomous driving's security and feasibility to perceive the surrounding environment under complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we proposed P-CSG, a novel penalty-based imitation learning approach with cross semantics generation sensor fusion technologies to increase the overall performance of End-to-End Autonomous Driving. We conducted an assessment of our model's performance using the Town 05 Long benchmark, achieving an impressive driving score improvement of over 15%. Furthermore, we conducted robustness evaluations against adversarial attacks like FGSM and Dot attacks, revealing a substantial increase in robustness compared to baseline models.More detailed information, such as code-based resources, ablation studies and videos can be found at https://hk-zh.github.io/p-csg-plus.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07809">Communication Efficient Private Federated Learning Using Dithering</a><br>
                Authors: Burak Hasircioglu, Deniz Gunduz <br>
                Abstract: The task of preserving privacy while ensuring efficient communication is a fundamental challenge in federated learning. In this work, we tackle this challenge in the trusted aggregator model, and propose a solution that achieves both objectives simultaneously. We show that employing a quantization scheme based on subtractive dithering at the clients can effectively replicate the normal noise addition process at the aggregator. This implies that we can guarantee the same level of differential privacy against other clients while substantially reducing the amount of communication required, as opposed to transmitting full precision gradients and using central noise addition. We also experimentally demonstrate that the accuracy of our proposed approach matches that of the full precision gradient method.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07812">Text Classification of Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria</a><br>
                Authors: Yumeng Yang, Soumya Jayaraj, Ethan B Ludmir, Kirk Roberts <br>
                Abstract: Automatic identification of clinical trials for which a patient is eligible is complicated by the fact that trial eligibility is stated in natural language. A potential solution to this problem is to employ text classification methods for common types of eligibility criteria. In this study, we focus on seven common exclusion criteria in cancer trials: prior malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, psychiatric illness, drug/substance abuse, and autoimmune illness. Our dataset consists of 764 phase III cancer trials with these exclusions annotated at the trial level. We experiment with common transformer models as well as a new pre-trained clinical trial BERT model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of automatically classifying common exclusion criteria. Additionally, we demonstrate the value of a pre-trained language model specifically for clinical trials, which yields the highest average performance across all criteria.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07813">Directed Scattering for Knowledge Graph-based Cellular Signaling  Analysis</a><br>
                Authors: Aarthi Venkat, Joyce Chew, Ferran Cardoso Rodriguez, Christopher J. Tape, Michael Perlmutter, Smita Krishnaswamy <br>
                Abstract: Directed graphs are a natural model for many phenomena, in particular scientific knowledge graphs such as molecular interaction or chemical reaction networks that define cellular signaling relationships. In these situations, source nodes typically have distinct biophysical properties from sinks. Due to their ordered and unidirectional relationships, many such networks also have hierarchical and multiscale structure. However, the majority of methods performing node- and edge-level tasks in machine learning do not take these properties into account, and thus have not been leveraged effectively for scientific tasks such as cellular signaling network inference. We propose a new framework called Directed Scattering Autoencoder (DSAE) which uses a directed version of a geometric scattering transform, combined with the non-linear dimensionality reduction properties of an autoencoder and the geometric properties of the hyperbolic space to learn latent hierarchies. We show this method outperforms numerous others on tasks such as embedding directed graphs and learning cellular signaling networks.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07819">Decomposition of linear tensor transformations</a><br>
                Authors: Claudio Turchetti <br>
                Abstract: One of the main issues in computing a tensor decomposition is how to choose the number of rank-one components, since there is no finite algorithms for determining the rank of a tensor. A commonly used approach for this purpose is to find a low-dimensional subspace by solving an optimization problem and assuming the number of components is fixed. However, even though this algorithm is efficient and easy to implement, it often converges to poor local minima and suffers from outliers and noise. The aim of this paper is to develop a mathematical framework for exact tensor decomposition that is able to represent a tensor as the sum of a finite number of low-rank tensors. In the paper three different problems will be carried out to derive: i) the decomposition of a non-negative self-adjoint tensor operator; ii) the decomposition of a linear tensor transformation; iii) the decomposition of a generic tensor.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07822">CATfOOD: Counterfactual Augmented Training for Improving Out-of-Domain  Performance and Calibration</a><br>
                Authors: Rachneet Sachdeva, Martin Tutek, Iryna Gurevych <br>
                Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities at scale, particularly at generating text conditioned on a prompt. In our work, we investigate the use of LLMs to augment training data of small language models~(SLMs) with automatically generated counterfactual~(CF) instances -- i.e. minimally altered inputs -- in order to improve out-of-domain~(OOD) performance of SLMs in the extractive question answering~(QA) setup. We show that, across various LLM generators, such data augmentation consistently enhances OOD performance and improves model calibration for both confidence-based and rationale-augmented calibrator models. Furthermore, these performance improvements correlate with higher diversity of CF instances in terms of their surface form and semantic content. Finally, we show that CF augmented models which are easier to calibrate also exhibit much lower entropy when assigning importance, indicating that rationale-augmented calibrators prefer concise explanations.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07823">Large-scale Weakly Supervised Learning for Road Extraction from  Satellite Imagery</a><br>
                Authors: Shiqiao Meng, Zonglin Di, Siwei Yang, Yin Wang <br>
                Abstract: Automatic road extraction from satellite imagery using deep learning is a viable alternative to traditional manual mapping. Therefore it has received considerable attention recently. However, most of the existing methods are supervised and require pixel-level labeling, which is tedious and error-prone. To make matters worse, the earth has a diverse range of terrain, vegetation, and man-made objects. It is well known that models trained in one area generalize poorly to other areas. Various shooting conditions such as light and angel, as well as different image processing techniques further complicate the issue. It is impractical to develop training data to cover all image styles. This paper proposes to leverage OpenStreetMap road data as weak labels and large scale satellite imagery to pre-train semantic segmentation models. Our extensive experimental results show that the prediction accuracy increases with the amount of the weakly labeled data, as well as the road density in the areas chosen for training. Using as much as 100 times more data than the widely used DeepGlobe road dataset, our model with the D-LinkNet architecture and the ResNet-50 backbone exceeds the top performer of the current DeepGlobe leaderboard. Furthermore, due to large-scale pre-training, our model generalizes much better than those trained with only the curated datasets, implying great application potential.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07846">MC-NeRF: Muti-Camera Neural Radiance Fields for Muti-Camera Image  Acquisition Systems</a><br>
                Authors: Yu Gao, Lutong Su, Hao Liang, Yufeng Yue, Yi Yang, Mengyin Fu <br>
                Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) employ multi-view images for 3D scene representation and have shown remarkable performance. As one of the primary sources of multi-view images, multi-camera systems encounter challenges such as varying intrinsic parameters and frequent pose changes. Most previous NeRF-based methods often assume a global unique camera and seldom consider scenarios with multiple cameras. Besides, some pose-robust methods still remain susceptible to suboptimal solutions when poses are poor initialized. In this paper, we propose MC-NeRF, a method can jointly optimize both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields. Firstly, we conduct a theoretical analysis to tackle the degenerate case and coupling issue that arise from the joint optimization between intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Secondly, based on the proposed solutions, we introduce an efficient calibration image acquisition scheme for multi-camera systems, including the design of calibration object. Lastly, we present a global end-to-end network with training sequence that enables the regression of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, along with the rendering network. Moreover, most existing datasets are designed for unique camera, we create a new dataset that includes four different styles of multi-camera acquisition systems, allowing readers to generate custom datasets. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method when each image corresponds to different camera parameters. Specifically, we adopt up to 110 images with 110 different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, to achieve 3D scene representation without providing initial poses.

                Authors: Rong Li, ShiJie Li, Xieyuanli Chen, Teli Ma, Wang Hao, Juergen Gall, Junwei Liang <br>
                Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in enabling autonomous driving and robots to understand their surroundings accurately and robustly. There are different types of methods, such as point-based, range image-based, and polar-based. Among these, range image-based methods are widely used due to their balance between accuracy and speed. However, they face a significant challenge known as the ``many-to-one'' problem caused by the range image's limited horizontal and vertical angular resolution, where around 20% of the 3D points are occluded during model inference based on our observation. In this paper, we present TFNet, a range image-based LiDAR semantic segmentation method that utilizes temporal information to address this issue. Specifically, we incorporate a temporal fusion layer to extract useful information from previous scans and integrate it with the current scan. We then design a max-voting-based post-processing technique to correct false predictions, particularly those caused by the ``many-to-one'' issue. Experiments on two benchmarks and seven backbones of three modalities demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07852">ExpertQA: Expert-Curated Questions and Attributed Answers</a><br>
                Authors: Chaitanya Malaviya, Subin Lee, Sihao Chen, Elizabeth Sieber, Mark Yatskar, Dan Roth <br>
                Abstract: As language models are adapted by a more sophisticated and diverse set of users, the importance of guaranteeing that they provide factually correct information supported by verifiable sources is critical across fields of study & professions. This is especially the case for high-stakes fields, such as medicine and law, where the risk of propagating false information is high and can lead to undesirable societal consequences. Previous work studying factuality and attribution has not focused on analyzing these characteristics of language model outputs in domain-specific scenarios. In this work, we present an evaluation study analyzing various axes of factuality and attribution provided in responses from a few systems, by bringing domain experts in the loop. Specifically, we first collect expert-curated questions from 484 participants across 32 fields of study, and then ask the same experts to evaluate generated responses to their own questions. We also ask experts to revise answers produced by language models, which leads to ExpertQA, a high-quality long-form QA dataset with 2177 questions spanning 32 fields, along with verified answers and attributions for claims in the answers.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864">The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey</a><br>

                Abstract: For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent AI agents since the mid-20th century. However, these efforts have mainly focused on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a sufficiently general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse scenarios. Due to the versatile and remarkable capabilities they demonstrate, large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many research efforts have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and have achieved significant progress. We start by tracing the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs are suitable foundations for AI agents. Building upon this, we present a conceptual framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored to suit different applications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of LLM-based agents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and human-agent cooperation. Following this, we delve into agent societies, exploring the behavior and personality of LLM-based agents, the social phenomena that emerge when they form societies, and the insights they offer for human society. Finally, we discuss a range of key topics and open problems within the field.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07866">Gradient constrained sharpness-aware prompt learning for vision-language  models</a><br>
                Authors: Liangchen Liu, Nannan Wang, Dawei Zhou, Xinbo Gao, Decheng Liu, Xi Yang, Tongliang Liu <br>
                Abstract: This paper targets a novel trade-off problem in generalizable prompt learning for vision-language models (VLM), i.e., improving the performance on unseen classes while maintaining the performance on seen classes. Comparing with existing generalizable methods that neglect the seen classes degradation, the setting of this problem is more strict and fits more closely with practical applications. To solve this problem, we start from the optimization perspective, and leverage the relationship between loss landscape geometry and model generalization ability. By analyzing the loss landscape of the state-of-the-art method and the widely-used Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM), we conclude that the trade-off performance correlates to both loss value and loss sharpness, while each of them are indispensable. However, we find the optimizing gradient of existing methods cannot always maintain high consistency with both loss value and loss sharpness during the whole optimization procedure. To this end, we propose an novel SAM-based method for prompt learning, denoted as Gradient Constrained Sharpness-aware Context Optimization (GCSCoOp), to dynamically constrains the optimizing gradient, thus achieving above two-fold optimization objective simultaneously. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of GCSCoOp in the trade-off problem.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07867">Beta Diffusion</a><br>
                Authors: Mingyuan Zhou, Tianqi Chen, Zhendong Wang, Huangjie Zheng <br>
                Abstract: We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges. Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time. Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs, which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization. Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models, thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07870">Agents: An Open-source Framework for Autonomous Language Agents</a><br>

                Abstract: Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable researchers and developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve various tasks and interact with environments, humans, and other agents using natural language interfaces. We consider language agents as a promising direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for researchers.

                Authors: Federico Bianchi, Mirac Suzgun, Giuseppe Attanasio, Paul Röttger, Dan Jurafsky, Tatsunori Hashimoto, James Zou <br>
                Abstract: Training large language models to follow instructions makes them perform better on a wide range of tasks, generally becoming more helpful. However, a perfectly helpful model will follow even the most malicious instructions and readily generate harmful content. In this paper, we raise concerns over the safety of models that only emphasize helpfulness, not safety, in their instruction-tuning. We show that several popular instruction-tuned models are highly unsafe. Moreover, we show that adding just 3% safety examples (a few hundred demonstrations) in the training set when fine-tuning a model like LLaMA can substantially improve their safety. Our safety-tuning does not make models significantly less capable or helpful as measured by standard benchmarks. However, we do find a behavior of exaggerated safety, where too much safety-tuning makes models refuse to respond to reasonable prompts that superficially resemble unsafe ones. Our study sheds light on trade-offs in training LLMs to follow instructions and exhibit safe behavior.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07880">mEBAL2 Database and Benchmark: Image-based Multispectral Eyeblink  Detection</a><br>
                Authors: Roberto Daza, Aythami Morales, Julian Fierrez, Ruben Tolosana, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez <br>
                Abstract: This work introduces a new multispectral database and novel approaches for eyeblink detection in RGB and Near-Infrared (NIR) individual images. Our contributed dataset (mEBAL2, multimodal Eye Blink and Attention Level estimation, Version 2) is the largest existing eyeblink database, representing a great opportunity to improve data-driven multispectral approaches for blink detection and related applications (e.g., attention level estimation and presentation attack detection in face biometrics). mEBAL2 includes 21,100 image sequences from 180 different students (more than 2 million labeled images in total) while conducting a number of e-learning tasks of varying difficulty or taking a real course on HTML initiation through the edX MOOC platform. mEBAL2 uses multiple sensors, including two Near-Infrared (NIR) and one RGB camera to capture facial gestures during the execution of the tasks, as well as an Electroencephalogram (EEG) band to get the cognitive activity of the user and blinking events. Furthermore, this work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture as benchmark for blink detection on mEBAL2 with performances up to 97%. Different training methodologies are implemented using the RGB spectrum, NIR spectrum, and the combination of both to enhance the performance on existing eyeblink detectors. We demonstrate that combining NIR and RGB images during training improves the performance of RGB eyeblink detectors (i.e., detection based only on a RGB image). Finally, the generalization capacity of the proposed eyeblink detectors is validated in wilder and more challenging environments like the HUST-LEBW dataset to show the usefulness of mEBAL2 to train a new generation of data-driven approaches for eyeblink detection.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07887">Some notes concerning a generalized KMM-type optimization method for  density ratio estimation</a><br>

                Authors: Davinder Pal Singh, Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Bo Zhou, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz <br>
                Abstract: We present a novel local-global feature fusion framework for body-weight exercise recognition with floor-based dynamic pressure maps. One step further from the existing studies using deep neural networks mainly focusing on global feature extraction, the proposed framework aims to combine local and global features using image processing techniques and the YOLO object detection to localize pressure profiles from different body parts and consider physical constraints. The proposed local feature extraction method generates two sets of high-level local features consisting of cropped pressure mapping and numerical features such as angular orientation, location on the mat, and pressure area. In addition, we adopt a knowledge distillation for regularization to preserve the knowledge of the global feature extraction and improve the performance of the exercise recognition. Our experimental results demonstrate a notable 11 percent improvement in F1 score for exercise recognition while preserving label-specific features.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07891">HandNeRF: Learning to Reconstruct Hand-Object Interaction Scene from a  Single RGB Image</a><br>
                Authors: Hongsuk Choi, Nikhil Chavan-Dafle, Jiacheng Yuan, Volkan Isler, Hyunsoo Park <br>
                Abstract: This paper presents a method to learn hand-object interaction prior for reconstructing a 3D hand-object scene from a single RGB image. The inference as well as training-data generation for 3D hand-object scene reconstruction is challenging due to the depth ambiguity of a single image and occlusions by the hand and object. We turn this challenge into an opportunity by utilizing the hand shape to constrain the possible relative configuration of the hand and object geometry. We design a generalizable implicit function, HandNeRF, that explicitly encodes the correlation of the 3D hand shape features and 2D object features to predict the hand and object scene geometry. With experiments on real-world datasets, we show that HandNeRF is able to reconstruct hand-object scenes of novel grasp configurations more accurately than comparable methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that object reconstruction from HandNeRF ensures more accurate execution of a downstream task, such as grasping for robotic hand-over.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07899">Improving physics-informed DeepONets with hard constraints</a><br>

                Abstract: Current physics-informed (standard or operator) neural networks still rely on accurately learning the initial conditions of the system they are solving. In contrast, standard numerical methods evolve such initial conditions without needing to learn these. In this study, we propose to improve current physics-informed deep learning strategies such that initial conditions do not need to be learned and are represented exactly in the predicted solution. Moreover, this method guarantees that when a DeepONet is applied multiple times to time step a solution, the resulting function is continuous.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07900">Ambiguity-Aware In-Context Learning with Large Language Models</a><br>
                Authors: Lingyu Gao, Aditi Chaudhary, Krishna Srinivasan, Kazuma Hashimoto, Karthik Raman, Michael Bendersky <br>
                Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) i.e. showing LLMs only a few task-specific demonstrations has led to downstream gains with no task-specific fine-tuning required. However, LLMs are sensitive to the choice of prompts, and therefore a crucial research question is how to select good demonstrations for ICL. One effective strategy is leveraging semantic similarity between the ICL demonstrations and test inputs by using a text retriever, which however is sub-optimal as that does not consider the LLM's existing knowledge about that task. From prior work (Min et al., 2022), we already know that labels paired with the demonstrations bias the model predictions. This leads us to our hypothesis whether considering LLM's existing knowledge about the task, especially with respect to the output label space can help in a better demonstration selection strategy. Through extensive experimentation on three text classification tasks, we find that it is beneficial to not only choose semantically similar ICL demonstrations but also to choose those demonstrations that help resolve the inherent label ambiguity surrounding the test example. Interestingly, we find that including demonstrations that the LLM previously mis-classified and also fall on the test example's decision boundary, brings the most performance gain.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07906">Generative Image Dynamics</a><br>
                Authors: Zhengqi Li, Richard Tucker, Noah Snavely, Aleksander Holynski <br>
                Abstract: We present an approach to modeling an image-space prior on scene dynamics. Our prior is learned from a collection of motion trajectories extracted from real video sequences containing natural, oscillating motion such as trees, flowers, candles, and clothes blowing in the wind. Given a single image, our trained model uses a frequency-coordinated diffusion sampling process to predict a per-pixel long-term motion representation in the Fourier domain, which we call a neural stochastic motion texture. This representation can be converted into dense motion trajectories that span an entire video. Along with an image-based rendering module, these trajectories can be used for a number of downstream applications, such as turning still images into seamlessly looping dynamic videos, or allowing users to realistically interact with objects in real pictures.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07909">Boosting Unsupervised Contrastive Learning Using Diffusion-Based Data  Augmentation From Scratch</a><br>
                Authors: Zelin Zang, Hao Luo, Kai Wang, Panpan Zhang, Fan Wang, Stan.Z Li, Yang You <br>
                Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning methods have recently seen significant improvements, particularly through data augmentation strategies that aim to produce robust and generalizable representations. However, prevailing data augmentation methods, whether hand designed or based on foundation models, tend to rely heavily on prior knowledge or external data. This dependence often compromises their effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the applicability of most existing data augmentation strategies is limited when transitioning to other research domains, especially science-related data. This limitation stems from the paucity of prior knowledge and labeled data available in these domains. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffAug-a novel and efficient Diffusion-based data Augmentation technique. DiffAug aims to ensure that the augmented and original data share a smoothed latent space, which is achieved through diffusion steps. Uniquely, unlike traditional methods, DiffAug first mines sufficient prior semantic knowledge about the neighborhood. This provides a constraint to guide the diffusion steps, eliminating the need for labels, external data/models, or prior knowledge. Designed as an architecture-agnostic framework, DiffAug provides consistent improvements. Specifically, it improves image classification and clustering accuracy by 1.6%~4.5%. When applied to biological data, DiffAug improves performance by up to 10.1%, with an average improvement of 5.8%. DiffAug shows good performance in both vision and biological domains.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07910">TEMPO: Efficient Multi-View Pose Estimation, Tracking, and Forecasting</a><br>
                Authors: Rohan Choudhury, Kris Kitani, Laszlo A. Jeni <br>
                Abstract: Existing volumetric methods for predicting 3D human pose estimation are accurate, but computationally expensive and optimized for single time-step prediction. We present TEMPO, an efficient multi-view pose estimation model that learns a robust spatiotemporal representation, improving pose accuracy while also tracking and forecasting human pose. We significantly reduce computation compared to the state-of-the-art by recurrently computing per-person 2D pose features, fusing both spatial and temporal information into a single representation. In doing so, our model is able to use spatiotemporal context to predict more accurate human poses without sacrificing efficiency. We further use this representation to track human poses over time as well as predict future poses. Finally, we demonstrate that our model is able to generalize across datasets without scene-specific fine-tuning. TEMPO achieves 10$\%$ better MPJPE with a 33$\times$ improvement in FPS compared to TesseTrack on the challenging CMU Panoptic Studio dataset.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07911">Disentangling Spatial and Temporal Learning for Efficient Image-to-Video  Transfer Learning</a><br>
                Authors: Zhiwu Qing, Shiwei Zhang, Ziyuan Huang, Yingya Zhang, Changxin Gao, Deli Zhao, Nong Sang <br>
                Abstract: Recently, large-scale pre-trained language-image models like CLIP have shown extraordinary capabilities for understanding spatial contents, but naively transferring such models to video recognition still suffers from unsatisfactory temporal modeling capabilities. Existing methods insert tunable structures into or in parallel with the pre-trained model, which either requires back-propagation through the whole pre-trained model and is thus resource-demanding, or is limited by the temporal reasoning capability of the pre-trained structure. In this work, we present DiST, which disentangles the learning of spatial and temporal aspects of videos. Specifically, DiST uses a dual-encoder structure, where a pre-trained foundation model acts as the spatial encoder, and a lightweight network is introduced as the temporal encoder. An integration branch is inserted between the encoders to fuse spatio-temporal information. The disentangled spatial and temporal learning in DiST is highly efficient because it avoids the back-propagation of massive pre-trained parameters. Meanwhile, we empirically show that disentangled learning with an extra network for integration benefits both spatial and temporal understanding. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DiST delivers better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods by convincing gaps. When pre-training on the large-scale Kinetics-710, we achieve 89.7% on Kinetics-400 with a frozen ViT-L model, which verifies the scalability of DiST.

                Authors: Yuting Wang, Velibor Ilic, Jiatong Li, Branislav Kisacanin, Vladimir Pavlovic <br>
                Abstract: Object detection (OD), a crucial vision task, remains challenged by the lack of large training datasets with precise object localization labels. In this work, we propose ALWOD, a new framework that addresses this problem by fusing active learning (AL) with weakly and semi-supervised object detection paradigms. Because the performance of AL critically depends on the model initialization, we propose a new auxiliary image generator strategy that utilizes an extremely small labeled set, coupled with a large weakly tagged set of images, as a warm-start for AL. We then propose a new AL acquisition function, another critical factor in AL success, that leverages the student-teacher OD pair disagreement and uncertainty to effectively propose the most informative images to annotate. Finally, to complete the AL loop, we introduce a new labeling task delegated to human annotators, based on selection and correction of model-proposed detections, which is both rapid and effective in labeling the informative images. We demonstrate, across several challenging benchmarks, that ALWOD significantly narrows the gap between the ODs trained on few partially labeled but strategically selected image instances and those that rely on the fully-labeled data. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/seqam-lab/ALWOD.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07915">MMICL: Empowering Vision-language Model with Multi-Modal In-Context  Learning</a><br>
                Authors: Haozhe Zhao, Zefan Cai, Shuzheng Si, Xiaojian Ma, Kaikai An, Liang Chen, Zixuan Liu, Sheng Wang, Wenjuan Han, Baobao Chang <br>
                Abstract: Starting from the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs) benefiting from large language models (LLMs) have never been so popular. However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images. The issue can traced back to the architectural design of VLMs or pre-training data. Specifically, the current VLMs primarily emphasize utilizing multi-modal data with a single image some, rather than multi-modal prompts with interleaved multiple images and text. Even though some newly proposed VLMs could handle user prompts with multiple images, pre-training data does not provide more sophisticated multi-modal prompts than interleaved image and text crawled from the web. We propose MMICL to address the issue by considering both the model and data perspectives. We introduce a well-designed architecture capable of seamlessly integrating visual and textual context in an interleaved manner and MIC dataset to reduce the gap between the training data and the complex user prompts in real-world applications, including: 1) multi-modal context with interleaved images and text, 2) textual references for each image, and 3) multi-image data with spatial, logical, or temporal relationships. Our experiments confirm that MMICL achieves new stat-of-the-art zero-shot and few-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks, especially for complex reasoning benchmarks including MME and MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively deals with the challenge of complex multi-modal prompt understanding. The experiments on ScienceQA-IMG also show that MMICL successfully alleviates the issue of language bias in VLMs, which we believe is the reason behind the advanced performance of MMICL.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07917">Looking at words and points with attention: a benchmark for  text-to-shape coherence</a><br>
                Authors: Andrea Amaduzzi, Giuseppe Lisanti, Samuele Salti, Luigi Di Stefano <br>
                Abstract: While text-conditional 3D object generation and manipulation have seen rapid progress, the evaluation of coherence between generated 3D shapes and input textual descriptions lacks a clear benchmark. The reason is twofold: a) the low quality of the textual descriptions in the only publicly available dataset of text-shape pairs; b) the limited effectiveness of the metrics used to quantitatively assess such coherence. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive solution that addresses both weaknesses. Firstly, we employ large language models to automatically refine textual descriptions associated with shapes. Secondly, we propose a quantitative metric to assess text-to-shape coherence, through cross-attention mechanisms. To validate our approach, we conduct a user study and compare quantitatively our metric with existing ones. The refined dataset, the new metric and a set of text-shape pairs validated by the user study comprise a novel, fine-grained benchmark that we publicly release to foster research on text-to-shape coherence of text-conditioned 3D generative models.

                Authors: Zeqi Xiao, Tai Wang, Jingbo Wang, Jinkun Cao, Wenwei Zhang, Bo Dai, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang <br>
                Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

                Authors: Ziang Cao, Fangzhou Hong, Tong Wu, Liang Pan, Ziwei Liu <br>
                Abstract: Creating diverse and high-quality 3D assets with an automatic generative model is highly desirable. Despite extensive efforts on 3D generation, most existing works focus on the generation of a single category or a few categories. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based feed-forward framework for synthesizing massive categories of real-world 3D objects with a single generative model. Notably, there are three major challenges for this large-vocabulary 3D generation: a) the need for expressive yet efficient 3D representation; b) large diversity in geometry and texture across categories; c) complexity in the appearances of real-world objects. To this end, we propose a novel triplane-based 3D-aware Diffusion model with TransFormer, DiffTF, for handling challenges via three aspects. 1) Considering efficiency and robustness, we adopt a revised triplane representation and improve the fitting speed and accuracy. 2) To handle the drastic variations in geometry and texture, we regard the features of all 3D objects as a combination of generalized 3D knowledge and specialized 3D features. To extract generalized 3D knowledge from diverse categories, we propose a novel 3D-aware transformer with shared cross-plane attention. It learns the cross-plane relations across different planes and aggregates the generalized 3D knowledge with specialized 3D features. 3) In addition, we devise the 3D-aware encoder/decoder to enhance the generalized 3D knowledge in the encoded triplanes for handling categories with complex appearances. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet and OmniObject3D (over 200 diverse real-world categories) convincingly demonstrate that a single DiffTF model achieves state-of-the-art large-vocabulary 3D object generation performance with large diversity, rich semantics, and high quality.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07921">OpenIllumination: A Multi-Illumination Dataset for Inverse Rendering  Evaluation on Real Objects</a><br>

                Authors: Madeline Navarro, Santiago Segarra <br>
                Abstract: The myriad complex systems with multiway interactions motivate the extension of graph-based pairwise connections to higher-order relations. In particular, the simplicial complex has inspired generalizations of graph neural networks (GNNs) to simplicial complex-based models. Learning on such systems requires large amounts of data, which can be expensive or impossible to obtain. We propose data augmentation of simplicial complexes through both linear and nonlinear mixup mechanisms that return mixtures of existing labeled samples. In addition to traditional pairwise mixup, we present a convex clustering mixup approach for a data-driven relationship among several simplicial complexes. We theoretically demonstrate that the resultant synthetic simplicial complexes interpolate among existing data with respect to homomorphism densities. Our method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets for simplicial complex classification.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07663">Dataset Size Dependence of Rate-Distortion Curve and Threshold of  Posterior Collapse in Linear VAE</a><br>
                Authors: Yuma Ichikawa, Koji Hukushima <br>
                Abstract: In the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the variational posterior often aligns closely with the prior, which is known as posterior collapse and hinders the quality of representation learning. To mitigate this problem, an adjustable hyperparameter beta has been introduced in the VAE. This paper presents a closed-form expression to assess the relationship between the beta in VAE, the dataset size, the posterior collapse, and the rate-distortion curve by analyzing a minimal VAE in a high-dimensional limit. These results clarify that a long plateau in the generalization error emerges with a relatively larger beta. As the beta increases, the length of the plateau extends and then becomes infinite beyond a certain beta threshold. This implies that the choice of beta, unlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse regardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires careful tuning. Furthermore, considering the dataset-size dependence on the rate-distortion curve, a relatively large dataset is required to obtain a rate-distortion curve with high rates. Extensive numerical experiments support our analysis.<br><br>Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07779">Convergence analysis of online algorithms for vector-valued kernel  regression</a><br>
                Authors: Michael Griebel, Peter Oswald <br>
                Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the regression function from noisy vector-valued data by an online learning algorithm using an appropriate reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) as prior. In an online algorithm, i.i.d. samples become available one by one by a random process and are successively processed to build approximations to the regression function. We are interested in the asymptotic performance of such online approximation algorithms and show that the expected squared error in the RKHS norm can be bounded by $C^2 (m+1)^{-s/(2+s)}$, where $m$ is the current number of processed data, the parameter $0<s\leq 1$ expresses an additional smoothness assumption on the regression function and the constant $C$ depends on the variance of the input noise, the smoothness of the regression function and further parameters of the algorithm.
